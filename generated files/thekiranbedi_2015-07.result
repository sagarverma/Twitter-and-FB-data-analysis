By effective,strong and non sparing response to war of terror by all organs of the State,people of India have sent a powerful message to all
Like media restrained itself on live telecast of Gurdaspur encounter can similar restraint be for blow by blow account of #YakubHanged now?
In #YakubHanged,The Legal profession, TheJudiciary, Executive and even the Society have been stretched to the full..Lessons to be learnt?
Yakub finally hung. After unprecedented night long Supreme Court proceedings. Defence Lawyer still not respectful in accepting the verdict..
President of India rejects mercy petition. #YakubMemon will be hung tomorrow 7am...in Nagpur jail. So..finally Gallows for Yakub..
RT @IndiaToday: We have not heard even a single word of apology or regret from Yakub Memon in all these years @thekiranbedi #NTA9 http://t.
Key basis of seeking mercy is declaration of an unconditional apology+realisation of guilt and seek apology from victims.Did #YakubMemon do?
Country's highest Court has spoken.Courts at different levels hav examined evidence in #YakubMemon case 6 times.Those seeking mercy haven't
Indian culture as I have grown up with has not been one of revenge.Its been of wider message of prevention and deterrence for larger good..
Is it justified for the merciless to seek mercy?And those not their direct victims of violence seek mercy?Can d suffering victims b ignored?
....victims are totally dependent on the State for a just closure. While accused even after being convicted tries his max to keep it open...
....and victims are entirely dependent on the State for justice. Therefore the onus is on the State to ensure suffering victims get justice
There are two sides of all crimes.The perpetrator and the victims. The former is defended by defence lawyers and the victims by the State..!
....These Fake accounts attribute to me all kinds of Statements. Sometimes words which are not even in my vocabulary. Forced to report...
Frds my webmaster has reported that there are ONLY 96 Fake Accounts in my name on Facebook and Twitter. My own accts on FB+TW are verified..

We thank our brave Punjab Cops &amp; Police Leadership..also deeply regret loss of innocent lives..Hope we do not plead mercy for the captured..
If perpetrators are not going to abjure violence,our responses have to change. Our prevention strategies have to become more comprehensive..
Key buffer of terror attacks is grass root,ground level police presence to gather real time info/intelligence.This is scarcer by the day..
Punjab police is a very brave force. It's martial in mind set.They will not spare any. Media must show restraint in projection of encounter

When Greece like situation happens,it's due to blunders committed by lenders and borrowers,politically driven for their mercenary interests
There is a clear message for Indian Banks too in the Greece crisis...against their burgeoning NPAs...lots Expected from our RBI Governor...
We hope GOI+State Govts are drawing lessons from Greece financial crisis.To protect the country and its citizens for now &amp; future @PMOIndia
If India is to protect itself a Greece like situation ever, GOI/ State Govts must publish quarterly fact sheets on financial health..PIL?
If media can't do treasury watch,let a credible NGO do. Like we had association of demo reforms,ADR? We cud have AFE.(Financial Expenditure)
Media ought to also monitor every quarter state-wise treasury situation. Debit &amp; credit side, for people to know how is their 
Govt running?
Before voting, voters must learn to ask the financial health of their State, and what is being promised where and how will money be found?
One of the several lessons for governance is..don't fall into a debt trap...which few of our States within our own Union are at the brink..
