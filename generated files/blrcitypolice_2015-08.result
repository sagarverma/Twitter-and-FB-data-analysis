 Dear Brother s and Sisters, 
The concept of ICE !!!!                                    THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

We all carry our Mobile Phones with Names and Numbers stored in its Memory but nobody, other than Ourselves, knows which of these numbers belong to our Closest Family or Friends. 

If we were to be involved in an Accident or were taken Ill, the People attending us would have our Mobile phone but wouldn't know whom to call. Yes, there are hundreds of numbers Stored but which one is the contact person in case of an Emergency?                                                Hence this "ICE" (In Case of Emergency) Campaign. 

The concept of "ICE" is catching on quickly. It is a method of contact during Emergency situations. As Cell phones are carried by the majority of the Population, all you need to do is store the number of a contact Person or Persons whom should be contacted during Emergency under the name "ICE" ( In Case Of Emergency). 

The idea was thought up by a Paramedic who found that when he went to the scenes of Accidents, there were always Mobile phones with Patients, but they didn't know which number to call. He therefore thought that it would be a Good idea if there was a Nationally recognized Name for this purpose. In an Emergency situation, Emergency Service Personnel and Hospital Staff would be able to quickly contact the right person by dialing the number You have stored as "ICE." 

For more than One contact name simply enter ICE1, ICE2 and ICE3 etc.                        A Great Idea that will make a Difference! 

Let's spread the concept of ICE by storing an ICE number in our Mobile Phones today! 

e.g.
Name  ICE SRIKANTHA
No.     +91XXXXXXXXX

Please forward this. It won't take too many "Forwards" before everybody will know about this It really could save your Life, or put a Loved one's Mind at Rest, Please send this to Your Near and Dear one. 

Remember:- 
ICE will speak for You when You are not able to....

Many citizens just like me travel from electronic city to silk board Junction.Every day at the silk board signal,Electronic city toll gate we see a group of Hijada's demanding for money atleast of Rs 10/- .

This problem we common citizen facing daily.

Why is the local police not taking any action towards this and why should we face this daily useless issue inspite of calling 100 and informing regularly.

We citizens need police help and immediate action.

We have been observing this notorious activity for long while and daily we see no police at the electronic city toll and silk board junction taking any action  .
The traffic police is standing at corner and watching the money collected by these Transgender/Hijada's people.

We citizens need police help and immediate action.

This is the post share by North East Girl, getting viral in media : Please take appropriate action against whoever are involved.  

She was just another East Indian girl studying in Bangalore but what Prerna Sharma faced in Bangalore on 12th August will make you shiver in shock. She writes an open letter to Shri Narendra Modi asking for Justice.

Here is the letter -

Dear PMO India,

INDEPENDENCE day is here and I am feeling as if I cant get outside on road freely and without any fear! Sir, I am a Student from one of the reputed engineering college of Bangalore called DSI, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering.On 12 august 2015, I became a victim of ROAD ACCIDENT, PUBLIC ASSAULT, ATTEMPT TO MOLEST & ATTEMPT TO MURDER that too outside my own college campus where i have been for 4 long years.The story is too long and brutal but I know you will take your valuable time to read it as i have faith on the Prime Minister of India whose motto is 'BETI BACHAO,BETI PARHAO' !

A 45 to 50 yrs aged man was about to hit my vehicle with his two wheeler " KA03TL203 " when i moved to the left and avoided the accident & lost balance and felt down. I got up and sat on my vehicle and this man started abusing me and when i tried to drive away he pulled my scooty from behind but somehow i escaped his catch.Later he shouted in Kannada to a tall fat and muscled man to stop me & this tall man pushed headlights of my vehicle which made me fall again and my specs,watch & helmet were thrown away and again i got injured.I again got up but before i could realize anything the man who was abusing me before came and banged my head with a helmet.Then came the Public , Auto drivers, Shopkeepers and surrounded me and each of them blaming me for what i still don't know. I got away and started walking towards the man's vehicle and noted down his vehicle number. When i got back to my scooty 25 to 30 men again surrounded me and snatched my scooty keys LOCKED it and started touching me with wrong intentions.The way in which the people were supporting the scooty person makes it clear that they all have planned it well and belonged to a common group of criminals. I told them to return it so that i can go home, they made fun of me.Then i asked them to at least give my wallet which was locked in my scooty but they dint.Now they told me that you are a NORTH INDIAN & you cant do anything because no police authority is going to help you here in South India! They told me ' let me see how you escape from here' ! I knew two three words in Kannada and i started shouting these words and pushed one of them to make way and ran out of their. NOBODY helped me out,they all supported a man hitting abusing assaulting a GIRL that too PUBLICLY ! All were having fun watching what was happening.I asked people around to give me their phone to make a call to police but nobody wanted to get involved. I walked a little further and requested a Mehendi wala who agreed to make a call on my friends number who stayed nearby. When my friend came and just for asking the key back they all hit him Brutally, banged his head to a tree and punched his eyes face ears and stomach.I saw nobody came to help and he was half dead getting beaten by these criminals. I moved into the crowd and held his hand to get him out,they punched on my nose and kicked my back.I started shouting that ' come we are going to police, we are getting out of here' and somehow got out and sat in an auto and left for police station.After reaching there the police didn't come with us to the Scene for another 1 hour and made us wait asking the same incident again and again.We were not provided Casual MEDICAL service for three hours until we screamed and warned the police. We have also caught an auto driver who has beaten us and the police says he has been sent to Central jail. And despite of providing the police with the vehicle number of the man they are saying that it is not a correct number. Me and My friend would have lost our lives.I am not safe which means no other girl is.I used to wonder how crime takes place and today i know this well. Police were making fun of me just because i dont understand their local language. I want to know who is going to get me JUSTICE? I look up to you and i don't want to be a victim but a Fighter. HELP me LIKE a FATHER, TREAT me LIKE your DAUGHTER !

We at The Indian Breeze don't want to walk another candle light vigil for another Nirbhaya and I am sure whoever is reading it certainly don't want as well. Instead we want to make sure that there's no girl in India that suffers Nirbhaya's fate.

We request Shri Narendra Modi to kindly intervene in this matter and punish the miscreants as soon as possible.

Election day, not voting. 49-O vs NOTA
=============================================
Sir,  Many of us were planning to exercise NOTA. We are not happy with the candidates, And do not want to stay at home and not vote.
Since the SEC has decided to violate the SC judgement, and not support NOTA, we are planning to exercise rule 49-O, which the SC had ordered to be replaced by the NOTA button.
If the polling booth officer is not aware of rule 49-O or does not allow it to be cast, We will sign the register, Get our finger inked and walk out of the polling booth without pressing any button on the EVM.
We will later use the RTI ACT to check whether the polling agent allowed any fake voting on our name. (Total votes should be less than total signatures)

Requesting you to make the necessary arrangement so that citizens standing up for our rights does not disturb the peace.

Can something be done here? Just a fair unbiased probe at least?
Today at 12:15pm afternoon Makri circle toward to Munnireddy palya 
Taking in Mobile phone and Ridding Vehicle
9916695977- do not answer any calls from this number.. One lady calls me and says  she is calling from HDFC credit card, said I asked her to talk to my husband, says some random number and PRabhakar, is who she spoke to .. So wanted to talk about my account..
 Point 1 the number she told is incorrect and I have never ever shared any details with the bank.
Point 2 they just went and called a random stranger named Prabhakar and told him my personal details.
Point 3 when I yell at her and tel her that I want to go talk to manager, she has the audacity to tell me that she is alone, she is only the manager and doesn't have a name . point 4 I ask for branch details and code , she disconnects the call.. Thus happens 6 times..  
Posting it here only to create awareness among people. Please do not give out your bank details to ANYONE .. Do let me know how to take action against such fraudsters..

It's a nightmare to drive on hosur road especially at the huskur gate as the highway is used by walking public than the vehicles.  I request the traffic police to look into this issue.  I don't know why people use the highway when there is a subway to cross the road.

Respected Sir / Madam,

On 18-08-2015 @ 01:48am somebody had hacked my official Gmail account.

The official Gmail account hacked was jupiterenterpriseswhitefield@gmail.com

I came to know that this account was hacked by some one at around 08:00am on the same day.

I had received a mail from gmail team at the same time on my personal gmail I'd praveenvariyath@gmail.com, since I had given this id as my alternative email I'd for the hacked I'd.

The person whomever had hacked my official Gmail account had changed only the password other than that all the identity are same.

Regarding this issue i had been to whitefield police station immediately when I found that my Gmail account had hacked, I met the writer in front of police station & told him everything, he asked me to give a compliment in writing & asper I did the same & he acknowledge it too & asked me to come at around 05:00pm on the same day (since the S.I was busy in C.M duty at morning), later I went to at 05:00pm asper writer asked me to come & met the S.I & was unable to talk to him because again he was busy in election duty & hurriedly the S.I went out. Later a constable took me to a person who sits in front of computer, he told me to send complaint to gmail team & asper I did it immediately on support.google.com & he said me the complaint which I gave in writing & which was acknowledged by the writer is more than enough.

Even I called up cyber crime team for help but nobody answered my call.

Don't know what to do, Whitefield police team, Gmail team & Cyber crime team is not helping me to come out of this issue & finally I am posting it here I'm BCP hoping that someone will help me.

Since B.B.M.P election are in Process and Terrorism are in progress I am 100% sure my offIcial gmail 'd is been misused by somebody for illegal activities.

I kindly request BCP team to take action to the person who had hacked my official Gmail account & Please file an F.I.R for this issue & send me a copy of that to my personal gmail I'd. I am ready to come any ware for enquiry, please get me rid of it...

Kindly note : I don't want to cancel my hacked account but I want to recover the same because that is the account with all my customers.

Thank you,
Praveen.Menon

After hearing about the tragic death of the small girl at the Lalbagh Flowershow,  I am sharing some information of how to increase your chances of survival in case you are attacked by a swarm of angry bees. Please note even if you are not allergic to bee stings, being stung by a swarm can be lethal. 

Sprint away from the swarm as quickly as possible. Bees can fly at a top speed of 15 miles per hour though they usually fly around 9 miles per hour. Depending on how angry they are and the type of bee, you might be able to out run them but not for very long. Some types of bees are more determined to hurt you for downing their hive and will give chase for over a mile.

Get indoors if possible. If you are in a residential area or near a car, put windows and walls between you and the bees. It's likely that a few will follow you in, but 1 or 2 bees are easier to contend with than 700.

Head for thick brush if you are in the wilderness. Tall grass, bushes, high weeds, or dense forest will all help you out considerably. Though it may slow your progress some, the vegetation actually provides cover for you. If chasing you becomes complicated, bees will often lose interest.

Divide and conquer. If you are with someone else, split off in different directions. With more than one aggressor, bees will become confused and disband. You will likely both have bees chasing you, but contending with half of a swarm is better than a whole.

Maintain a straight trajectory. Don't zigzag through a wooded area because you will be crossing ground you've already been over and can potentially pick up stragglers. Always keep a straight line directly away from the hive.

Remove the stinger as soon as possible if you are stung because it will continue to inject venom as long as it's embedded. To remove a stinger, drag your fingertips over it as though you were scratching a deep itch. Squeezing a stinger to remove it can cause the remaining venom to release into you.

Had a horrible experience with auto driver at Murgeshpalya auto stand on 17th Aug 9 pm. I and my wife boarded this auto no. 1861 and midway he stopped and picked two other passenger. When I objected, he threatened me and asked me to get down. I realized that he was drunk and no point arguing. As I got down he started abusing me. I was concerned about my wife's safety so I did not react and walked off. We started moving away and I tried clicking picture of his auto number plate. On this he charged at me and tried to hit me. He was abusive all this while. Such auto drivers are a threat and terror on roads compromising safety of people. I am concerned about safety of my wife as she boards auto from same stand everyday. I would like to know what action police will take here?
Team, you need a take a look at what's happening in Majestic Bus Terminal. Both subway and flyover in the bus terminal is filled with sex workers. Annoying to use flyover or subway, kindly look into this. Saddest part is that police were around and these peeps were walking around like free birds. With more than lakhs of people commuting thru this part of Bangalore, no one should carry cheap perception about our city.

PS: tried to capture images or videos, my friend stopped me, asked to check YouTube and found more videos related to this.

Dear Sir/Madam
I got a challan for a wrong parking violation yesterday - for a wrong parking in 10th Main Road, Jayanagar.
I live in Sarjapur Road, and have NEVER visited Jaynagar in my life.
The car is barely few months old, and I only use it within 4-5 kms distance to office.
You can check my GPS records of both husband & wife. I saw online that it might be due to a typing mistake (http://www.bangaloremirror.com//W/articleshow/28965258.cms)
Request you to please remove this from my record immediately.
Challan Number - 13138171
Vehicle Number - KA51MF9817
There is no photo proof also attached online! How is this possible?

Dear Sir,
following is my dilemma and I seek your intervention in it.
On 26th July I lost my mobile phone. I went to the nearest police station (Peenya) to lodge a complaint. I had to visit the police station the next day i.e. on 27th with original bills and I was made to lodge a missing phone complaint. I had got my cell phone insured for theft. The phone company has given me a format to write to the same missing report and the police station has to endorse it with a stamp and signature. I was asked to wait for 15-20 days so that the phone can be traced. I again visited the police station on 16th August. The person at the desk prepared the non traceable letter but asked me to return in the after noon so that it can be signed by the concerned authority. When I went again in the afternoon I was asked to come at 9PM as the person who prepared the letter had left for the day. When I asked them to sign on the format given by the insurance company, they refused. This happened despite me showing them the signed copies which the insurance company had given me as samples. The same missing report is to be written in that insurance company format and the police station has to acknowledge by putting a stamp on it. 
Hope you will be able advice me on this.

This is in regards to an incident which took place under hebbal flyover when me and my husband were returning back from office today evening. One car ( KA 07 M2569) came beside us and hit our car, when we tried to protest what he is doing was wrong, he came out of his car along with another guy(both of them fully drunk) started physically hitting my husband, slapped him and abusing us in Kannada. We hail from Orissa and we were not able to understand any of his abusing words. Few commuters helped us rescue from these unsocial elements. Traffic police were nowhere to be seen. 
We still are in a state of shock thinking of what was our fault!  Why did he come and hit my husband without any fault of my husband? Is the only reason being that we cannot speak Kannada? We both along with  our family is really sad to have experienced this shameful abuse in a city like Bangalore which we thought to be our very own! This was regional abuse and physical harassment too.

Hello Sir, Just wanted to thank Frazer Town and K.G Halli Police station for searching my Lost KTM Duke 200 bike. I lost the bike on July 23 and was found this month.

Hello Sir,
Greetings of the day.
Can you please tell us if there is any law on rented houses ? 
Taking a house for rent in Bangalore has become very difficult these days. First of all, the rents are very high which we can understand. But the problem is the Advance which the owners collect 10 months of the monthly rent. Everytime,  I change my house, I had to pay not less than 1 lakh. And the worst part is, when vacating, they exclude most of the money saying the reasons like white wash, house cleaning and etc. 
We request BENGALURU CITY POLICE to consider this seriously and let us know if there is any law where we can follow on this.or atleast someone where we can approach for help. Thank you Very much Sir

Grippy of people were smoking in the interval Where there was a Board too saying"No Smoking". When we went and adviced the group they did not bother to stop instead they started abusing us.  When the incident reported to the theatre authority they told us to adjust as they can't do anything. . This is common in most public places. . Just quoted one example.  What can common man do if these type of incident happens.  Hoping for a valid feedback.  Thanks in advance. .

An Open Letter to the Prime Minister of India from a girl of Ranchi who is studying in Banglore -
Please Read ...
Dear #PMOindia,
INDEPENDENCE day is here and I am feeling as if I cant get outside on road freely and without any fear! Sir, I am a Student from one of the reputed engineering college of Bangalore #DSI #dayanandasagarcollegeofengineering.On 12 august 2015, I became a victim of ROAD ACCIDENT, PUBLIC ASSAULT, ATTEMPT TO MOLEST & ATTEMPT TO MURDER that too outside my own college campus where i have been for 4 long years.The story is too long and brutal but I know you will take your valuable time to read it as i have faith on the Prime Minister of India whose motto is 'BETI BACHAO,BETI PARHAO' ! 
A 45 to 50 yrs aged man was about to hit my vehicle with his two wheeler
" KA03TL203 " when i moved to the left and avoided the accident & lost balance and felt down. I got up and sat on my vehicle and this man started abusing me and when i tried to drive away he pulled my scooty from behind but somehow i escaped his catch.Later he shouted in Kannada to a tall fat and muscled man to stop me & this tall man pushed headlights of my vehicle which made me fall again and my specs,watch & helmet were thrown away and again i got injured.I again got up but before i could realize anything the man who was abusing me before came and banged my head with a helmet.Then came the Public , Auto drivers, Shopkeepers and surrounded me and each of them blaming me for what i still don't know. I got away and started walking towards the man's vehicle and noted down his vehicle number. When i got back to my scooty 25 to 30 men again surrounded me and snatched my scooty keys LOCKED it and started touching me with wrong intentions.The way in which the people were supporting the scooty person makes it clear that they all have planned it well and belonged to a common group of criminals. I told them to return it so that i can go home they made fun of me.Then i asked them to atleast give my wallet which was locked in my scooty but they dint.Now they told me that you are a NORTH INDIAN & you cant do anything because no police authority is going to help you here in South India! They told me ' let me see how you escape from here' ! i knew two three words in Kannada and i started shouting these words and pushed one of them to make way and ran out of their. NOBODY helped me out,they all supported a man hitting abusing assaulting a GIRL that too PUBLICLY ! All were having fun watching what was happening.I asked people around to give me their phone to make a call to police but nobody wanted to get involved. I walked a little further and requested a Mehendi wala who agreed to make a call on my friends number who stayed nearby. When my friend came and just for asking the key back they all hit him Brutally, banged his head to a tree and punched his eyes face ears and stomach.I saw nobody came to help and he was half dead getting beaten by these criminals. I moved into the crowd and held his hand to get him out,they punched on my nose and kicked my back.I started shouting that ' come we are going to police, we are getting out of here' and somehow got out and sat in an auto and left for police station.After reaching there the police didn't come with us to the Scene for another 1 hour and made us wait asking the same incident again and again.We were not provided Casualty MEDICAL service for three hours until we screamed and warned the police. We have also Catched an auto driver who has beaten us and the police says he has been sent to Central jail. And despite of providing the police with the vehicle number of the man they are saying that it is not a correct number. Me and My friend would have lost our lives.I am not safe which means no other girl is.I used to wonder how crime takes place and today i know this well. Police were making fun of me just because i dont understand their local language. I want to know who is going to get me JUSTICE? I look up to you and i don't want to be a victim but a Fighter. HELP me LIKE a FATHER, TREAT me LIKE your DAUGHTER !
Somebody help me on how do i reach this letter to the President !

On the eve of Independence Day, it is sad to see that rules and regulations are being breached. Non-Stop loud music is being played within the campus of "Hotel Royal Orchid".
Address1, Golf Avenue, Adjoining KGA Golf Course, Old Airport Rd, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560008. Phone:080 4178 3000

Its 00:37 AM IST and in spite of multiple calls to police control room and the hotel itself, there is no stoppage to the loud music being played in their campus.

Hope the concerned authorities will take necessary corrective action.
I salute the honesty and sincerity of the cops Mr.chandrana ASI and mr. Chandrana constable and Mr. Patil from adugodi policr station swift action against nuisance created by neighbour cops behave very politely hats off to them.
Thank you sir from the bottom of my heart
Hello Everyone 
I wanted to bring to notice a incident which happened today morning at 5 AM .I booked a Uber in Bangalore for one of my friends , and the driver accepted the ride and came to the pick up location .After climbing the cab he started hurling abuses and dropped my friend in No man's land .It was really scary as he didn't give any reasons for not completing the ride.
I called another Uber and the previous driver chased my friend and got physical as my friend had taken a video of him abusing and had noted the car number on the video.
This video is the evidence of the arrogance of Uber.
This can happen to anyone and i would request you to take appropriate action as per the rules book.

Today's trip started around 9 pm and will go on till 6 am tomorrow. Unable to sleep peacefully as this makes lot of noise.

Hi BCP, along the stretch of Banaswadi Main Road from Jai Bharath Nagar all the way to Maruti Sevanagar, shop keepers on the left of the road have invaded onto the footpath. The footpaths in these areas are just about 4-5 feet wide and most of these shops seem to have occupied half the space. It gets for pedestrians to use the footpath. Even more when there are pedestrians walking on the opposite direction. Can the shopkeepers be mandated to use only their property for business and not beyond?
Sorry for my previous post that was happened by me and that will not happen in future and my sincere apologies for this problem, and  accepted my apologies. @

Hi, 
Please do not block the right turn from Manyata tech Park Gate 2 (towards hebbal). It is causing a huge traffic jam. Worse than when the right turn was free. We spend almost 20 mins to just take the U-turn and go towards hebbal.
What can be done is block it in the morning time and release it in the evening. Or please do not block it at all it was much better last time.

Dear BENGALURU CITY POLICE. Of late you seem to be taking up important issues, especially regarding traffic. Please also seriously
take up the implementation of the ban on public smoking. It is common sight to see people smoking in public and most of these smokers do not have any sensitivity to the people around who would also be paying a huge price for no fault of theirs. Many of the smokers are also rude to requests of non-smokers. Their refrain normally is that it is a public place and no one has a right to question them. Just look around and you would see huge crowds in front of all small shops that sell cigarettes.

Hello sirs/madam,

There is this insensitive person who frequents a restaurant near our home. He smokes right out in a public place and doesn't stop when when asked to. He first tried to say what he was smoking was not a cigarette. Then claimed he has been to the u.s. and has smoked there. Can anybody advice me on how I get this person to stop? 

Also request anybody who sees this image to share this on your timeline so that if this person is on Facebook it can reach him and his near ones.

I checked with the restaurant management and they say they cannot do much as he is someone known to the owner of this layout.

Comparative account of Indian police per lac of population. Another important factor which needs to be sorted out.
Some people are trying to steal bikes and in the process damaging the bikes at the public parking under hebbal flyover (beside the K2 bus stop on the police station side). Stealing petrol was there sometimes, but recently they are trying to remove wiring and trying to break the locks. Some of my friends faced this last week and i faced it today evening. The police station is not far from this parking lot and still such event are happening.  Can something be done about this?

nanna suggestions:

In all Companies

Make Parking Fee 5000 per car per Month
2000 per Bike Per Month
200 per car per day and 100 per bike per day
Free company transportation

by this at least 50% of people will stop travelling by car/bike.
Dear Bengaluru City Police, foothpath vendors have illegally occupied the complete stretch opposite to iGATE in EPIP 2nd phase, Whitefield. As a result of this, it is very difficult to walk on the footpath eventually it obstructs the traffic. They have made the place so dirty as well. Please take some action regarding this.

***PRESS NOTE***
respected sir just want to know when ever we park our vehicle we pay parking fee and there will be mentioned on the ticket PARKING AT OWNERS RISK then why should we pay & park our vehicles if they are charging then there should be some security for our vehicle in this manner there will be less vehicle theft because without parking ticket you cannot take your vehicle and robbers will find it difficult to do it and the parking owners will have to take strick action if the vehicle is taken without producing parking ticket  HOPE THIS WILL BE SOME USEFUL TO SOME BANGALOREANS

Dear Team

I live in #37,1st Cross, 2nd Main, Cambridge Layout, Ulsoor, BLR -8,
We live in the last house which is just near the Main Channel and there is this ISRO SLUM. They are a huge trouble for us, as they come near our house (where is there is a empty corner area) sit and take drugs, smoke and drink in the night times. If we ask them something they try to use all kinds of abusive language even on women and try to hit my father and husband. 

This is a every day problem for us these days. Last night we had the same kind of problem when called Ulsoor Police Station they disconnected the call by saying that part of the area belongs to Indiranagar Police Station.

By the time we reach 100 and ask them to send someone. They all do things which we cant explain run inside the Slum and hide themselves.

All of us in this area have off-street parking. They all have so many vehicles that we cannot park our vehicles at all. Even for that we have to struggle fight and do all kinds of things.

We normally dont get any support from anyone atleast in this forum I hope to get some kind of support.

My Father is retired HAL Employee and is 67years old. He is Diabetic and very weak. Mother is just a house wife.

I am more concerned about my parents and children as they dont have anyone for support. I am the only child married, but both my husband and myself work and return back home very late.

Please, help us get ride these problems. I had to write all the problems hence a very long post.

Regards
Nikhisha Hema

I Lost my office Laptop with Bag on inner Ring Road near Embassy Golf Links at 5:15PM IST on  10th Aug and was raining at the time. I have visited two police stations nearby and was not ready to book complaint because of Jurisdiction and were pointing me to different police station. Finally I got to correct police station, Halasur. But Halasur police is asking me to provide company video footage (to prove that I came out with bag from office) to book complaint. But they do neither ready to take complaint nor ready to check my company video footage to investigate before taking cognizance of the crime. This is very absurd  reply instead showing sympathy and help aggrieved. 

I spoke to my company officials and are ready to provide Video Footage. I am posting on your page to seek help from Police officials.
This Vehicle was found parked @ the lane opposite The Taza Tindi jayanagar 9th Block. this Morning with the national flag tied to the foot rest of the vehicle

#OnlineSafety : The Internet generally offers great opportunities for children to learn and play, there are some areas of cyberspace that are not appropriate. Parents need to ensure children are actively supervised when using the Internet, particularly time spent chatting online.

Steps for improving your child's safety

Be aware of the programs and files children use.
Consider installing filtering software on computers used by young people.
Be aware of the programs and files that are on your family's computers.
Place the computer in a public area of the home, such as a living room.
Ensure you are able to access your child's email and randomly check the contents.
Check your phone bill for unusual outgoing calls or consider using a 'caller ID' device to identify incoming calls.
Discuss online safety with your child's school, public library or anywhere that you believe your child accesses the Internet.
Make sure children are aware of some of the issues involved with spending time on the Internet.
Show children what sites they can go to and what information they can send out.
Sit down with your children and discuss the issues.

Appreciation post
Incident: 10 mins ago....
Location: Masala Galli..

Two Constables from Commercial Street Poice Station were on there regular beat rounds and they managed to save an Activa on spot as it was not locked...

A guy was sitting on the bike and trying to steal it as he saw the two constables he quickly ran away..

Due to the sound of the constables conversation just peeped out and the constables happened to take the bike to Commercial Street PS for security reasons, spoke to them and locked the vehicle.

Requested them to wait so i can take a picture and post it but they were not ready to a picture...
Upon requesting many times one of the cop happened to day his name as "Manu"....

Really appreciate the hard work of the two constables and there politeness, would request the authorities to send a letter of thank you on behalf of me.

Thank You

This is to bring to your notice that the bus driver with the above details was driving rashly, he just rammed up. The number of times he honked was subsequently equivalent to number of seconds in a minute. Please take an action.

Got a pre-recorded Hindi speaking female voice call from +1 (876) 648-0047 Jamaica. #BewareFraud Disconnect ~#Wangiri #IRSCallScam #Vishing
Dear BTP,

Kindly recognize the traffic hurdle at Bommanahalli signal, From any side to and fro, It at-least takes an hour during peak hours.While reason being local moving traffic, While forgetting the major traffic is going straight.

Here is the possible solution : 
By implementing the Dividers that assist the vehicles going straight.
while vehicles to turn to right/left need to be FORCED on the correct lane.
Imp* : Need to provide a constricted lane for the forwarding traffic. 

Simply by common sense it is possible to resolve with minimum efforts. But lack of interest seems evident here! 

Get back to me if u need help
Sir,

The 19th cross, 6th phase, J.P.Nagar from 33rd main that is from guru bar and restaurant to srinivasa nursery has become a hell It is dead end and at 33rd main junction itself the autorikshaws totally block the road, In case if we are lucky we cannot even think of crossing guru bar. Forget about the vehicles, even walking is a nightmare. Added to that the cigrate  shop attached to the guru bar will have a dozen of people smoking openly. Last time when we called the J.P.Nagar police, the ASI who came in a jeep reprimanded the residents saying that it is only a parking problem. We are fed up. 
Today morning around 10 am, when my daughter took out her Honda amaze car to go to the office, on tempo trax hoisting a political party flag had blocked the entire road in front of guru bar and when my daughter asked them to give the way. The have abused her in singular and have asked her to go and complain to any body she dares to complain. And they have stared at her indecently. 

We do not know what to do. We cannot vacate the place also as most of us are still paying housing loan and no body dare to buy a house in our apartment. 

I really doubt that whether we are living in a democratic country or in a terrorist infested place. 

Added to all these there is an unauthorized flag post covering one third of the the road, that is always surrounded by autorikshaw drivers about whom it is better not to mention also. They synonym with goondas

Hope at least our plight will catch a responsible officers attention

Oh god save us.

Date & Time: 9th Aug 2015 (Sunday) around 12.30 pm
Traffic police I interacted with: Mr. Siddegowda ST (K R Puram police station)

I went to pick up my family coming from Chennai. I reached there by around 12 pm. There were plenty of cars (at least 20 taxi and private cars) parked outside the station and the parking fee collector directed me to park my car in the same row. I saw him directing other cars and collect parking fee from them. I too paid Rs.30/- as parking fee and got a receipt.

Later, I came back to the parking area with my family (around 12.30 pm). I could see most of the cars parked around mine were missing and there was a traffic cop talking to some car owners. Puzzled, I went near my car when the traffic cop (Mr. Siddegowda ST) came and demanded a fine of Rs.100/- for parking in a no parking zone!

I was totally confused at this point and showed the parking fee receipt to the cop. He looked at the receipt and immediately replied that those people wanted money so they took it and went away and that if I have any issues, I should go to the police station and complain. But in any case, I will have to pay him the fine.

I tried to reason with Mr. Siddegowda ST but he wouldn't budge. He did not give me any valid response other than telling me that I am an educated man so I should not have parked in a no parking zone and that if I have any complaints I should go to the police station and complain! I finally paid the fine of Rs.100/- and got the receipt.

Now, following are the points I made to Mr. Siddegowda ST and I would like to raise the same with the Bangalore traffic police department. He could not give me any convincing answers I hope at least you will:

Point 1: Is the entire incident staged? 
 Scene 1: Some people taking charge, posing as parking fee collectors and organize the parking in a no-parking zone just before the train arrives. 
 Scene 2: The parking area is full, they vanish from the scene. 
 Scene 3: Moments later, after the train arrives, traffic police appear from no-where and start issuing no-parking tickets. 

Things became obvious to me later. The police controlling traffic at the junction could NOT have missed the action of so many cars being invited to park at a no-parking zone. Did they simply choose to turn a blind eye?! If they were really duty conscious, why didn't they take matter into their hands then and there rather than wait for the entire space to be filled up and then start issuing tickets? 
Therefore, I seriously doubt the involvement of traffic police too in what looks like an organized broad-day-light-cheating of the public! Isn't this a nexus between the traffic police and the so called parking fee collectors? Why would the department allow their personnel to make some quick money by cheating the public? Is it not your duty to prevent a crime when you have the chance rather than take action once its done?

Point 2: I am a law abiding citizen:
 I pay my taxes on time. 
 My car is a Kerala registered vehicle. But since I use it in Bangalore, I have paid a hefty road tax (KA) here as well. 
 I always buy platform tickets even in stations where it is not usually checked. 
 Even after all the arguments I had with Mr. Siddegowda ST, I paid him the no-parking fine because I knew I was at fault too. I should perhaps have noticed the no-parking sign and not parked there at all. BUT, I urge the authorities to think from a common man's perspective. It is easy for anyone to miss/ignore the no-parking sign when you are being invited to what looks like a parking lot by people posing themselves as a parking fee collectors, when there are plenty of cars being parked already. 
 I am sure there are many Indians in this city, like me. Is it too much to expect some reciprocation, some honesty and responsibility from the authorities as well?

I request the Bangalore traffic police to look into the matter take necessary action against the people involved, to prevent these kinds of unwanted incidents in future.

Kind regards,
Suresh K

Now, following are the points I made to Mr. Siddegowda ST and I would like to raise the same with the Bangalore traffic police department. He could not give me any convincing answers I hope at least you will:

Point 1: Is the entire incident staged? 
 Scene 1: Some people taking charge, posing as parking fee collectors and organize the parking in a no-parking zone just before the train arrives. 
 Scene 2: The parking area is full, they vanish from the scene. 
 Scene 3: Moments later, after the train arrives, traffic police appear from no-where and start issuing no-parking tickets. 

Things became obvious to me later. The police controlling traffic at the junction could NOT have missed the action of so many cars being invited to park at a no-parking zone. Did they simply choose to turn a blind eye?! If they were really duty conscious, why didn't they take matter into their hands then and there rather than wait for the entire space to be filled up and then start issuing tickets? 
Therefore, I seriously doubt the involvement of traffic police too in what looks like an organized broad-day-light-cheating of the public! Isn't this a nexus between the traffic police and the so called parking fee collectors? Why would the department allow their personnel to make some quick money by cheating the public? Is it not your duty to prevent a crime when you have the chance rather than take action once its done?

Point 2: I am a law abiding citizen:
 I pay my taxes on time. 
 My car is a Kerala registered vehicle. But since I use it in Bangalore, I have paid a hefty road tax (KA) here as well. 
 I always buy platform tickets even in stations where it is not usually checked. 
 Even after all the arguments I had with Mr. Siddegowda ST, I paid him the no-parking fine because I knew I was at fault too. I should perhaps have noticed the no-parking sign and not parked there at all. BUT, I urge the authorities to think from a common man's perspective. It is easy for anyone to miss/ignore the no-parking sign when you are being invited to what looks like a parking lot by people posing themselves as a parking fee collectors, when there are plenty of cars being parked already. 
 I am sure there are many Indians in this city, like me. Is it too much to expect some reciprocation, some honesty and responsibility from the authorities as well?

I request the Bangalore traffic police to look into the matter take necessary action against the people involved, to prevent these kinds of unwanted incidents in future.

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring an incident to your attention that happened with me yesterday.

Place: Outside Krishnarajapuram (K R Puram) railway station (Old madras road side)
Date & Time: 9th Aug 2015 (Sunday) around 12.30 pm
Traffic police I interacted with: Mr. Siddegowda ST (K R Puram police station)

I went to pick up my family coming from Chennai. I reached there by around 12 pm. There were plenty of cars (at least 20 taxi and private cars) parked outside the station and the parking fee collector directed me to park my car in the same row. I saw him directing other cars and collect parking fee from them. I too paid Rs.30/- as parking fee and got a receipt.

Later, I came back to the parking area with my family (around 12.30 pm). I could see most of the cars parked around mine were missing and there was a traffic cop talking to some car owners. Puzzled, I went near my car when the traffic cop (Mr. Siddegowda ST) came and demanded a fine of Rs.100/- for parking in a no parking zone!

I was totally confused at this point and showed the parking fee receipt to the cop. He looked at the receipt and immediately replied that those people wanted money so they took it and went away and that if I have any issues, I should go to the police station and complain. But in any case, I will have to pay him the fine.

I tried to reason with Mr. Siddegowda ST but he wouldn't budge. He did not give me any valid response other than telling me that I am an educated man so I should not have parked in a no parking zone and that if I have any complaints I should go to the police station and complain!

 Even after all the arguments I had with Mr. Siddegowda ST, I paid him the no-parking fine because I knew I was at fault too. I should perhaps have noticed the no-parking sign and not parked there at all. BUT, I urge the authorities to think from a common man's perspective. It is easy for anyone to miss/ignore the no-parking sign when you are being invited to what looks like a parking lot by people posing themselves as a parking fee collectors, when there are plenty of cars being parked already. 
 I am sure there are many Indians in this city, like me. Is it too much to expect some reciprocation, some honesty and responsibility from the authorities as well?

I request the Bangalore traffic police to look into the matter take necessary action against the people involved, to prevent these kinds of unwanted incidents in future.

Kind regards,
Suresh K

Sir,

Below is a reproduced fb post on one of the incident happened today. Request you to please take action on the same.

ARE WE BEING EXPLOITED???

Hi friends,

This is Mastan and Srinivas, normal citizens of India leading our life with everyday struggles to meet basic things even in the 21st century.

We are here to share one of the disturbing incident which most of us come across every day or the other, still forget and go on....

We went to Majestic (KSRTC Terminal  3 Bengaluru) to receive parents (of srinivas) on 09.08.2015 around 5:00 PM. We were waiting for the bus to arrive and thought of taking a soft drink (sprite). The MRP was Rs. 34. Whereas the shopkeeper demanded Rs. 40. We questioned why the extra charge over and above MRP. The shopkeeper refused to answer us. LIKE MOST OF OUR FELLOW INDIANS WE HAD GONE AHEAD BY PAYING THE AMOUNT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH. Casually, we had checked the same with another shop in Bus stand and was not surprised to know the same rate as earlier one.

Here the incident happens. We then went to a nandini outlet in the same Bus stand to purchase Milk Peda. The MRP was Rs. 80 and the shopkeeper demanded Rs. 85 not to our surprise. This time we questioned what is the basis of price, rate card, permission letter for sale of high price. The shopkeeper in a rough tone (In local language Kannada) replied nothing is there and take at price whatever we sell or leave from this place. We again questioned you dont have any right to sell at an unauthorized price and kept on our stand. This time the GUNDA angle in him came out shouting at us. He even took a Rs. 100 note and challenged to buy a single product at MRP in the any of the outlet in all 3 KSRTC terminals of Majestic. We were surprised to know that the DANDA happens in a syndicate and no one is afraid of any rule or regulation. The situation heated up and the shopkeeper challenged us to do whatever we want. They started calling their fellow members to threaten us. We took the photographs of the outlet and person and left from the place. 

The message here is targeted to those like us who internally feel Why is it like this?? and then with a Ufffff.. forget and go on to avoid any issue, for we are so afraid (ARE WE REALLY AFRAID??) and Chalta hai.. attitude. This has been taken advantageously by many great people like those in Bus stands, auto drivers, Petrol Bunks, Bus Conductors, Provisional stores and list goes on without limit in our country. Unless we change our attitude and question, all these smart people shall continue to make us fools.

Just think over the incident that happened to us. We can draw following inferences.
1.All the outlets in Bus stands of Majestic area sell products at rate more than MRP. It is syndicate network of shopkeepers selling Items at an unauthorized price.
2.Shopkeepers are not even afraid of any authority. This hints at possible involvement of concerned officials in the activity.
3.This is something happening very openly for a long time without regulation. Thus this can also be seen as a failure of Vigilance of KSRTC and other regulatory authorities (Knowingly or unknowingly).
4.We may feel what are we losing by paying an extra pie???? But we are forgetting how much we are being exploited indirectly. Just see below a small statistics on this.
a.The average extra money charged over MRP : 20-25%.
b. As per 2009 statistics, approx passenger flow in Majestic per 
day: 1.62 L 
c. Number of passengers who make a purchase (say 60% of 
people): 0.97 L
d. Spending per passenger (say): Rs. 50.
e. Total spending of passengers per day in Majestic: Rs. 48.6 L
f. Extra money spent over MRP per day (20% and 
unaccounted): Rs. 9.72 L
g. Extra money spent over MRP per year (20% and 
unaccounted): Rs. 35.48 Crores
Where is this unaccounted money going??????????

5. The above is a small example of a small shops in one Bus stand of Bengaluru. Just imagine the expanse of unaccounted money in various fields in the whole country. Now we can pretty be sure why the price of commodities are shooting up, real estate prices are sky rocketing. 
6. The net effect is nothing is in his reach to buy for a normal citizen leading his day today life.

So friends, should we allow all these people to exploit us????? Please do not pay an extra rupee over what is supposed to be. Let us question all such acts in a GANDHIAN manner. We are not so optimistic that some immediate miracle would happen. But we believe that every drop makes Ocean. Let us raise our voice to all such things. In a broader perspective, Let all such noble acts brings a day where we stop fantasizing about western developed countries and the reverse happens.

And finally, please do not stop with just reading, which will make our effort in bringing it to you and your time in reading shall be worthless.

JAI HIND.....

Dear Sir,

Few mins back I got a call from +91 7261 071 715 this number who spoke to me in Hindi and introduced them self as bank officers and asked me if you are using Debit card. I got to know that they are cheaters but still i continued to speak to them to check what all information they may ask. They first told your card has been blocked and if you want it open please confirm your 16 digit card number, expiry date & cvv number. I just disconnected the call scolding them not to cheat anyone like this. However, I know they will try to fool others in same way and if it work they will cheat them. Hence, I am requesting you to take some action on these people.

Thanks,

 Dear Brother s and Sisters, 
The concept of ICE !!!!                                    THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

We all carry our Mobile Phones with Names and Numbers stored in its Memory but nobody, other than Ourselves, knows which of these numbers belong to our Closest Family or Friends. 

If we were to be involved in an Accident or were taken Ill, the People attending us would have our Mobile phone but wouldn't know whom to call. Yes, there are hundreds of numbers Stored but which one is the contact person in case of an Emergency?                                                Hence this "ICE" (In Case of Emergency) Campaign. 

The concept of "ICE" is catching on quickly. It is a method of contact during Emergency situations. As Cell phones are carried by the majority of the Population, all you need to do is store the number of a contact Person or Persons whom should be contacted during Emergency under the name "ICE" ( In Case Of Emergency). 

The idea was thought up by a Paramedic who found that when he went to the scenes of Accidents, there were always Mobile phones with Patients, but they didn't know which number to call. He therefore thought that it would be a Good idea if there was a Nationally recognized Name for this purpose. In an Emergency situation, Emergency Service Personnel and Hospital Staff would be able to quickly contact the right person by dialing the number You have stored as "ICE." 

For more than One contact name simply enter ICE1, ICE2 and ICE3 etc.                        A Great Idea that will make a Difference! 

Let's spread the concept of ICE by storing an ICE number in our Mobile Phones today! 

e.g.
Name  ICE SRIKANTHA
No.     +91XXXXXXXXX

Please forward this. It won't take too many "Forwards" before everybody will know about this It really could save your Life, or put a Loved one's Mind at Rest, Please send this to Your Near and Dear one. 

Remember:- 
ICE will speak for You when You are not able to....

This is the post share by North East Girl, getting viral in media : Please take appropriate action against whoever are involved.  

She was just another East Indian girl studying in Bangalore but what Prerna Sharma faced in Bangalore on 12th August will make you shiver in shock. She writes an open letter to Shri Narendra Modi asking for Justice.

Here is the letter -

Dear PMO India,

INDEPENDENCE day is here and I am feeling as if I cant get outside on road freely and without any fear! Sir, I am a Student from one of the reputed engineering college of Bangalore called DSI, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering.On 12 august 2015, I became a victim of ROAD ACCIDENT, PUBLIC ASSAULT, ATTEMPT TO MOLEST & ATTEMPT TO MURDER that too outside my own college campus where i have been for 4 long years.The story is too long and brutal but I know you will take your valuable time to read it as i have faith on the Prime Minister of India whose motto is 'BETI BACHAO,BETI PARHAO' !

A 45 to 50 yrs aged man was about to hit my vehicle with his two wheeler " KA03TL203 " when i moved to the left and avoided the accident & lost balance and felt down. I got up and sat on my vehicle and this man started abusing me and when i tried to drive away he pulled my scooty from behind but somehow i escaped his catch.Later he shouted in Kannada to a tall fat and muscled man to stop me & this tall man pushed headlights of my vehicle which made me fall again and my specs,watch & helmet were thrown away and again i got injured.I again got up but before i could realize anything the man who was abusing me before came and banged my head with a helmet.Then came the Public , Auto drivers, Shopkeepers and surrounded me and each of them blaming me for what i still don't know. I got away and started walking towards the man's vehicle and noted down his vehicle number. When i got back to my scooty 25 to 30 men again surrounded me and snatched my scooty keys LOCKED it and started touching me with wrong intentions.The way in which the people were supporting the scooty person makes it clear that they all have planned it well and belonged to a common group of criminals. I told them to return it so that i can go home, they made fun of me.Then i asked them to at least give my wallet which was locked in my scooty but they dint.Now they told me that you are a NORTH INDIAN & you cant do anything because no police authority is going to help you here in South India! They told me ' let me see how you escape from here' ! I knew two three words in Kannada and i started shouting these words and pushed one of them to make way and ran out of their. NOBODY helped me out,they all supported a man hitting abusing assaulting a GIRL that too PUBLICLY ! All were having fun watching what was happening.I asked people around to give me their phone to make a call to police but nobody wanted to get involved. I walked a little further and requested a Mehendi wala who agreed to make a call on my friends number who stayed nearby. When my friend came and just for asking the key back they all hit him Brutally, banged his head to a tree and punched his eyes face ears and stomach.I saw nobody came to help and he was half dead getting beaten by these criminals. I moved into the crowd and held his hand to get him out,they punched on my nose and kicked my back.I started shouting that ' come we are going to police, we are getting out of here' and somehow got out and sat in an auto and left for police station.After reaching there the police didn't come with us to the Scene for another 1 hour and made us wait asking the same incident again and again.We were not provided Casual MEDICAL service for three hours until we screamed and warned the police. We have also caught an auto driver who has beaten us and the police says he has been sent to Central jail. And despite of providing the police with the vehicle number of the man they are saying that it is not a correct number. Me and My friend would have lost our lives.I am not safe which means no other girl is.I used to wonder how crime takes place and today i know this well. Police were making fun of me just because i dont understand their local language. I want to know who is going to get me JUSTICE? I look up to you and i don't want to be a victim but a Fighter. HELP me LIKE a FATHER, TREAT me LIKE your DAUGHTER !

We at The Indian Breeze don't want to walk another candle light vigil for another Nirbhaya and I am sure whoever is reading it certainly don't want as well. Instead we want to make sure that there's no girl in India that suffers Nirbhaya's fate.

We request Shri Narendra Modi to kindly intervene in this matter and punish the miscreants as soon as possible.

@BlrCityPolice 
Many citizens just like me travel from electronic city to silk board Junction.Every day at the silk board signal,Electronic city toll gate we see a group of Hijada's demanding for money atleast of Rs 10/- .

This problem we common citizen facing daily.

Why is the local police not taking any action towards this and why should we face this daily useless issue inspite of calling 100 and informing regularly.

We citizens need police help and immediate action. 
Many citizens just like me travel from electronic city to silk board Junction.Every day at the silk board signal,Electronic city toll gate we see a group of Hijada's/Transgender demanding for money atleast of Rs 10/- .

This is disturbing common citizens and need to face daily.

Why is the local police not taking any action towards this and why should we face this daily useless issue ,inspite of calling 100 and informing the issue.

We have been observing this notorious activity for long while and daily we see no police at the electronic city toll and silk board junction taking any action  .
The traffic police is standing at corner and watching the money collected by these Transgender/Hijada's people.

We citizens need police help and immediate action.

This is the post share by North East Girl, getting viral in media : Please take appropriate action against whoever are involved.  

She was just another East Indian girl studying in Bangalore but what Prerna Sharma faced in Bangalore on 12th August will make you shiver in shock. She writes an open letter to Shri Narendra Modi asking for Justice.

Here is the letter -

Dear PMO India,

INDEPENDENCE day is here and I am feeling as if I cant get outside on road freely and without any fear! Sir, I am a Student from one of the reputed engineering college of Bangalore called DSI, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering.On 12 august 2015, I became a victim of ROAD ACCIDENT, PUBLIC ASSAULT, ATTEMPT TO MOLEST & ATTEMPT TO MURDER that too outside my own college campus where i have been for 4 long years.The story is too long and brutal but I know you will take your valuable time to read it as i have faith on the Prime Minister of India whose motto is 'BETI BACHAO,BETI PARHAO' !

A 45 to 50 yrs aged man was about to hit my vehicle with his two wheeler " KA03TL203 " when i moved to the left and avoided the accident & lost balance and felt down. I got up and sat on my vehicle and this man started abusing me and when i tried to drive away he pulled my scooty from behind but somehow i escaped his catch.Later he shouted in Kannada to a tall fat and muscled man to stop me & this tall man pushed headlights of my vehicle which made me fall again and my specs,watch & helmet were thrown away and again i got injured.I again got up but before i could realize anything the man who was abusing me before came and banged my head with a helmet.Then came the Public , Auto drivers, Shopkeepers and surrounded me and each of them blaming me for what i still don't know. I got away and started walking towards the man's vehicle and noted down his vehicle number. When i got back to my scooty 25 to 30 men again surrounded me and snatched my scooty keys LOCKED it and started touching me with wrong intentions.The way in which the people were supporting the scooty person makes it clear that they all have planned it well and belonged to a common group of criminals. I told them to return it so that i can go home, they made fun of me.Then i asked them to at least give my wallet which was locked in my scooty but they dint.Now they told me that you are a NORTH INDIAN & you cant do anything because no police authority is going to help you here in South India! They told me ' let me see how you escape from here' ! I knew two three words in Kannada and i started shouting these words and pushed one of them to make way and ran out of their. NOBODY helped me out,they all supported a man hitting abusing assaulting a GIRL that too PUBLICLY ! All were having fun watching what was happening.I asked people around to give me their phone to make a call to police but nobody wanted to get involved. I walked a little further and requested a Mehendi wala who agreed to make a call on my friends number who stayed nearby. When my friend came and just for asking the key back they all hit him Brutally, banged his head to a tree and punched his eyes face ears and stomach.I saw nobody came to help and he was half dead getting beaten by these criminals. I moved into the crowd and held his hand to get him out,they punched on my nose and kicked my back.I started shouting that ' come we are going to police, we are getting out of here' and somehow got out and sat in an auto and left for police station.After reaching there the police didn't come with us to the Scene for another 1 hour and made us wait asking the same incident again and again.We were not provided Casual MEDICAL service for three hours until we screamed and warned the police. We have also caught an auto driver who has beaten us and the police says he has been sent to Central jail. And despite of providing the police with the vehicle number of the man they are saying that it is not a correct number. Me and My friend would have lost our lives.I am not safe which means no other girl is.I used to wonder how crime takes place and today i know this well. Police were making fun of me just because i dont understand their local language. I want to know who is going to get me JUSTICE? I look up to you and i don't want to be a victim but a Fighter. HELP me LIKE a FATHER, TREAT me LIKE your DAUGHTER !

We at The Indian Breeze don't want to walk another candle light vigil for another Nirbhaya and I am sure whoever is reading it certainly don't want as well. Instead we want to make sure that there's no girl in India that suffers Nirbhaya's fate.

We request Shri Narendra Modi to kindly intervene in this matter and punish the miscreants as soon as possible.

Election day, not voting. 49-O vs NOTA
=============================================
Sir,  Many of us were planning to exercise NOTA. We are not happy with the candidates, And do not want to stay at home and not vote.
Since the SEC has decided to violate the SC judgement, and not support NOTA, we are planning to exercise rule 49-O, which the SC had ordered to be replaced by the NOTA button.
If the polling booth officer is not aware of rule 49-O or does not allow it to be cast, We will sign the register, Get our finger inked and walk out of the polling booth without pressing any button on the EVM.
We will later use the RTI ACT to check whether the polling agent allowed any fake voting on our name. (Total votes should be less than total signatures)

 TRAFFIC AT 8.30 AM on Guttahalli road on Ballari road, Kasturaba road, Graphite India main road.
 What is #Ragging? it is a crime which destroys the physical and emotional confidence of an individual and can lead to serious consequences.The concept was introduced many years back to break the ice between juniors and seniors in an educational institute and to foster team spirit and healthy competitions.

In recent times, it has taken a serious turn and many unfortunate incidents have taken the life of young innocent victims. Hence, it has become necessary for the educational institute to take necessary steps in implementation of rules and regulations in prevention and prohibition of ragging in their campus.

In view of the same, an organized awareness programme was conducted in GKVK, Jakkur campus for 250 students. Subject matter experts from Parihar, Vibha and Aarthi addressed the gathering and briefed the consequence of  ragging. PSI Ramakrishna Reddy mentioned the various punishments that will be imposed right from paying fine to suspension from college.

We thank our Area Suraksha Mitra Dr.Harini Kumar and team GKVK for organizing and taking the necessary step to ensure a healthy atmosphere for the students during their academic year in the campus.

When i got back to my scooty 25 to 30 men again surrounded me and snatched my scooty keys LOCKED it and started touching me with wrong intentions.The way in which the people were supporting the scooty person makes it clear that they all have planned it well and belonged to a common group of criminals. I told them to return it so that i can go home, they made fun of me.Then i asked them to at least give my wallet which was locked in my scooty but they dint.Now they told me that you are a NORTH INDIAN & you cant do anything because no police authority is going to help you here in South India! They told me ' let me see how you escape from here' ! I knew two three words in Kannada and i started shouting these words and pushed one of them to make way and ran out of their. NOBODY helped me out,they all supported a man hitting abusing assaulting a GIRL that too PUBLICLY ! All were having fun watching what was happening.I asked people around to give me their phone to make a call to police but nobody wanted to get involved. I walked a little further and requested a Mehendi wala who agreed to make a call on my friends number who stayed nearby. When my friend came and just for asking the key back they all hit him Brutally, banged his head to a tree and punched his eyes face ears and stomach.I saw nobody came to help and he was half dead getting beaten by these criminals. I moved into the crowd and held his hand to get him out,they punched on my nose and kicked my back.I started shouting that ' come we are going to police, we are getting out of here' and somehow got out and sat in an auto and left for police station.After reaching there the police didn't come with us to the Scene for another 1 hour and made us wait asking the same incident again and again.We were not provided Casual MEDICAL service for three hours until we screamed and warned the police. We have also caught an auto driver who has beaten us and the police says he has been sent to Central jail. And despite of providing the police with the vehicle number of the man they are saying that it is not a correct number. Me and My friend would have lost our lives.I am not safe which means no other girl is.I used to wonder how crime takes place and today i know this well. Police were making fun of me just because i dont understand their local language. I want to know who is going to get me JUSTICE? I look up to you and i don't want to be a victim but a Fighter. HELP me LIKE a FATHER, TREAT me LIKE your DAUGHTER !

9916695977- do not answer any calls from this number.. One lady calls me and says  she is calling from HDFC credit card, said I asked her to talk to my husband, says some random number and PRabhakar, is who she spoke to .. So wanted to talk about my account..
 Point 1 the number she told is incorrect and I have never ever shared any details with the bank.
Point 2 they just went and called a random stranger named Prabhakar and told him my personal details.
Point 3 when I yell at her and tel her that I want to go talk to manager, she has the audacity to tell me that she is alone, she is only the manager and doesn't have a name . point 4 I ask for branch details and code , she disconnects the call.. Thus happens 6 times..  
Posting it here only to create awareness among people. Please do not give out your bank details to ANYONE .. Do let me know how to take action against such fraudsters..

Shri Ashish Kumar, Senior Advisor (TRW), Shri Ranjan  Mukherjee, Director (R&RT),Shri OP Shemar, Advisor (TR) along with Shri Ramachandra Rao, IPS, IGP, CTRS, Bengaluru. Dr. MA Saleem, IPS, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic briefed the delegates about TMC.
 What is #Ragging? it is a crime which destroys the physical and emotional confidence of an individual and can lead to serious consequences.The concept was introduced many years back to break the ice between juniors and seniors in an educational institute and to foster team spirit and healthy competitions.

In recent times, it has taken a serious turn and many unfortunate incidents have taken the life of young innocent victims. Hence, it has become necessary for the educational institute to take necessary steps in implementation of rules and regulations in prevention and prohibition of ragging in their campus.

In view of the same, an organized awareness programme was conducted in GKVK, Jakkur campus for 250 students. Subject matter experts from Parihar, Vibha and Aarthi addressed the gathering and briefed the consequence of  ragging. PSI Ramakrishna Reddy mentioned the various punishments that will be imposed right from paying fine to suspension from college.

We thank our Area Suraksha Mitra Dr.Harini Kumar and team GKVK for organizing and taking the necessary step to ensure a healthy atmosphere for the students during their academic year in the campus.

It's a nightmare to drive on hosur road especially at the huskur gate as the highway is used by walking public than the vehicles.  I request the traffic police to look into this issue.  I don't know why people use the highway when there is a subway to cross the road.

Respected Sir / Madam,

On 18-08-2015 @ 01:48am somebody had hacked my official Gmail account.

The official Gmail account hacked was jupiterenterpriseswhitefield@gmail.com

I came to know that this account was hacked by some one at around 08:00am on the same day.

I had received a mail from gmail team at the same time on my personal gmail I'd praveenvariyath@gmail.com, since I had given this id as my alternative email I'd for the hacked I'd.

The person whomever had hacked my official Gmail account had changed only the password other than that all the identity are same.

Regarding this issue i had been to whitefield police station immediately when I found that my Gmail account had hacked, I met the writer in front of police station & told him everything, he asked me to give a compliment in writing & asper I did the same & he acknowledge it too & asked me to come at around 05:00pm on the same day (since the S.I was busy in C.M duty at morning), later I went to at 05:00pm asper writer asked me to come & met the S.I & was unable to talk to him because again he was busy in election duty & hurriedly the S.I went out. Later a constable took me to a person who sits in front of computer, he told me to send complaint to gmail team & asper I did it immediately on support.google.com & he said me the complaint which I gave in writing & which was acknowledged by the writer is more than enough.

Even I called up cyber crime team for help but nobody answered my call.

Don't know what to do, Whitefield police team, Gmail team & Cyber crime team is not helping me to come out of this issue & finally I am posting it here I'm BCP hoping that someone will help me.

Since B.B.M.P election are in Process and Terrorism are in progress I am 100% sure my offIcial gmail 'd is been misused by somebody for illegal activities.

I kindly request BCP team to take action to the person who had hacked my official Gmail account & Please file an F.I.R for this issue & send me a copy of that to my personal gmail I'd. I am ready to come any ware for enquiry, please get me rid of it...

Kindly note : I don't want to cancel my hacked account but I want to recover the same because that is the account with all my customers.

Thank you,

After hearing about the tragic death of the small girl at the Lalbagh Flowershow,  I am sharing some information of how to increase your chances of survival in case you are attacked by a swarm of angry bees. Please note even if you are not allergic to bee stings, being stung by a swarm can be lethal. 

Sprint away from the swarm as quickly as possible. Bees can fly at a top speed of 15 miles per hour though they usually fly around 9 miles per hour. Depending on how angry they are and the type of bee, you might be able to out run them but not for very long. Some types of bees are more determined to hurt you for downing their hive and will give chase for over a mile.

Get indoors if possible. If you are in a residential area or near a car, put windows and walls between you and the bees. It's likely that a few will follow you in, but 1 or 2 bees are easier to contend with than 700.

Head for thick brush if you are in the wilderness. Tall grass, bushes, high weeds, or dense forest will all help you out considerably. Though it may slow your progress some, the vegetation actually provides cover for you. If chasing you becomes complicated, bees will often lose interest.

Divide and conquer. If you are with someone else, split off in different directions. With more than one aggressor, bees will become confused and disband. You will likely both have bees chasing you, but contending with half of a swarm is better than a whole.

Maintain a straight trajectory. Don't zigzag through a wooded area because you will be crossing ground you've already been over and can potentially pick up stragglers. Always keep a straight line directly away from the hive.

Remove the stinger as soon as possible if you are stung because it will continue to inject venom as long as it's embedded. To remove a stinger, drag your fingertips over it as though you were scratching a deep itch. Squeezing a stinger to remove it can cause the remaining venom to release into you.

Had a horrible experience with auto driver at Murgeshpalya auto stand on 17th Aug 9 pm. I and my wife boarded this auto no. 1861 and midway he stopped and picked two other passenger. When I objected, he threatened me and asked me to get down. I realized that he was drunk and no point arguing. As I got down he started abusing me. I was concerned about my wife's safety so I did not react and walked off. We started moving away and I tried clicking picture of his auto number plate. On this he charged at me and tried to hit me. He was abusive all this while. Such auto drivers are a threat and terror on roads compromising safety of people. I am concerned about safety of my wife as she boards auto from same stand everyday. I would like to know what action police will take here? 
Team, you need a take a look at what's happening in Majestic Bus Terminal. Both subway and flyover in the bus terminal is filled with sex workers. Annoying to use flyover or subway, kindly look into this. Saddest part is that police were around and these peeps were walking around like free birds. With more than lakhs of people commuting thru this part of Bangalore, no one should carry cheap perception about our city.

I got a challan for a wrong parking violation yesterday - for a wrong parking in 10th Main Road, Jayanagar.
I live in Sarjapur Road, and have NEVER visited Jaynagar in my life.
The car is barely few months old, and I only use it within 4-5 kms distance to office.
You can check my GPS records of both husband & wife. I saw online that it might be due to a typing mistake (http://www.bangaloremirror.com//W/articleshow/28965258.cms)
Request you to please remove this from my record immediately.

Dear Sir,
following is my dilemma and I seek your intervention in it.
On 26th July I lost my mobile phone. I went to the nearest police station (Peenya) to lodge a complaint. I had to visit the police station the next day i.e. on 27th with original bills and I was made to lodge a missing phone complaint. I had got my cell phone insured for theft. The phone company has given me a format to write to the same missing report and the police station has to endorse it with a stamp and signature. I was asked to wait for 15-20 days so that the phone can be traced. I again visited the police station on 16th August. The person at the desk prepared the non traceable letter but asked me to return in the after noon so that it can be signed by the concerned authority. When I went again in the afternoon I was asked to come at 9PM as the person who prepared the letter had left for the day. When I asked them to sign on the format given by the insurance company, they refused. This happened despite me showing them the signed copies which the insurance company had given me as samples. The same missing report is to be written in that insurance company format and the police station has to acknowledge by putting a stamp on it. 
Hope you will be able advice me on this.

This is in regards to an incident which took place under hebbal flyover when me and my husband were returning back from office today evening. One car ( KA 07 M2569) came beside us and hit our car, when we tried to protest what he is doing was wrong, he came out of his car along with another guy(both of them fully drunk) started physically hitting my husband, slapped him and abusing us in Kannada. We hail from Orissa and we were not able to understand any of his abusing words. Few commuters helped us rescue from these unsocial elements. Traffic police were nowhere to be seen. 
We still are in a state of shock thinking of what was our fault!  Why did he come and hit my husband without any fault of my husband? Is the only reason being that we cannot speak Kannada? We both along with  our family is really sad to have experienced this shameful abuse in a city like Bangalore which we thought to be our very own! This was regional abuse and physical harassment too.

Hello Sir, Just wanted to thank Frazer Town and K.G Halli Police station for searching my Lost KTM Duke 200 bike. I lost the bike on July 23 and was found this month. I am not sure if they have caught the thief. Thanks again. I was really happy with the co operation at Frazer Town Police station thanks the the sub inspector and his team. The bike is now at KG halli Police station, though the bike is damaged by the person who stole it. I will be able to get the bike once the formalities are done, but I would have been more happy if the formalities would have been faster since I am waiting for quite some time now. Thanks again Bangalore Police dept.

Hello Sir,
Greetings of the day.
Can you please tell us if there is any law on rented houses ? 
Taking a house for rent in Bangalore has become very difficult these days. First of all, the rents are very high which we can understand. But the problem is the Advance which the owners collect 10 months of the monthly rent. Everytime,  I change my house, I had to pay not less than 1 lakh. And the worst part is, when vacating, they exclude most of the money saying the reasons like white wash, house cleaning and etc. 
We request BENGALURU CITY POLICE to consider this seriously and let us know if there is any law where we can follow on this.or atleast someone where we can approach for help. Thank you Very much Sir

Order is passed by government that smoking in public place is banned. But still this is continuing in public places for example Movie theatre.  This insident Happened in HMT theatre in Jalahalli. Grippy of people were smoking in the interval Where there was a Board too saying"No Smoking". When we went and adviced the group they did not bother to stop instead they started abusing us.  When the incident reported to the theatre authority they told us to adjust as they can't do anything. . This is common in most public places. . Just quoted one example.  What can common man do if these type of incident happens.  Hoping for a valid feedback.  Thanks in advance. .

An Open Letter to the Prime Minister of India from a girl of Ranchi who is studying in Banglore -
Please Read ...
Dear #PMOindia,
INDEPENDENCE day is here and I am feeling as if I cant get outside on road freely and without any fear! Sir, I am a Student from one of the reputed engineering college of Bangalore #DSI #dayanandasagarcollegeofengineering.On 12 august 2015, I became a victim of ROAD ACCIDENT, PUBLIC ASSAULT, ATTEMPT TO MOLEST & ATTEMPT TO MURDER that too outside my own college campus where i have been for 4 long years.The story is too long and brutal but I know you will take your valuable time to read it as i have faith on the Prime Minister of India whose motto is 'BETI BACHAO,BETI PARHAO' ! 
A 45 to 50 yrs aged man was about to hit my vehicle with his two wheeler
" KA03TL203 " when i moved to the left and avoided the accident & lost balance and felt down. I got up and sat on my vehicle and this man started abusing me and when i tried to drive away he pulled my scooty from behind but somehow i escaped his catch.Later he shouted in Kannada to a tall fat and muscled man to stop me & this tall man pushed headlights of my vehicle which made me fall again and my specs,watch & helmet were thrown away and again i got injured.I again got up but before i could realize anything the man who was abusing me before came and banged my head with a helmet.Then came the Public , Auto drivers, Shopkeepers and surrounded me and each of them blaming me for what i still don't know. I got away and started walking towards the man's vehicle and noted down his vehicle number. When i got back to my scooty 25 to 30 men again surrounded me and snatched my scooty keys LOCKED it and started touching me with wrong intentions.The way in which the people were supporting the scooty person makes it clear that they all have planned it well and belonged to a common group of criminals. I told them to return it so that i can go home they made fun of me.Then i asked them to atleast give my wallet which was locked in my scooty but they dint.Now they told me that you are a NORTH INDIAN & you cant do anything because no police authority is going to help you here in South India! They told me ' let me see how you escape from here' ! i knew two three words in Kannada and i started shouting these words and pushed one of them to make way and ran out of their. NOBODY helped me out,they all supported a man hitting abusing assaulting a GIRL that too PUBLICLY ! All were having fun watching what was happening.I asked people around to give me their phone to make a call to police but nobody wanted to get involved. I walked a little further and requested a Mehendi wala who agreed to make a call on my friends number who stayed nearby. When my friend came and just for asking the key back they all hit him Brutally, banged his head to a tree and punched his eyes face ears and stomach.I saw nobody came to help and he was half dead getting beaten by these criminals. I moved into the crowd and held his hand to get him out,they punched on my nose and kicked my back.I started shouting that ' come we are going to police, we are getting out of here' and somehow got out and sat in an auto and left for police station.After reaching there the police didn't come with us to the Scene for another 1 hour and made us wait asking the same incident again and again.We were not provided Casualty MEDICAL service for three hours until we screamed and warned the police. We have also Catched an auto driver who has beaten us and the police says he has been sent to Central jail. And despite of providing the police with the vehicle number of the man they are saying that it is not a correct number. Me and My friend would have lost our lives.I am not safe which means no other girl is.I used to wonder how crime takes place and today i know this well. Police were making fun of me just because i dont understand their local language. I want to know who is going to get me JUSTICE? I look up to you and i don't want to be a victim but a Fighter. HELP me LIKE a FATHER, TREAT me LIKE your DAUGHTER !
Somebody help me on how do i reach this letter to the President !

Hello Everyone 
I wanted to bring to notice a incident which happened today morning at 5 AM .I booked a Uber in Bangalore for one of my friends , and the driver accepted the ride and came to the pick up location .After climbing the cab he started hurling abuses and dropped my friend in No man's land .It was really scary as he didn't give any reasons for not completing the ride.
I called another Uber and the previous driver chased my friend and got physical as my friend had taken a video of him abusing and had noted the car number on the video.
This video is the evidence of the arrogance of Uber.
This can happen to anyone and i would request you to take appropriate action as per the rules book.

Glad to share the impact of awareness programme - 

Child rights and child sexual abuse awareness programme was conducted in S.Ramakrishna Memorial Kannada Primary High School, Yelahanka on 13th Jan 2015. Recently it was brought to our notice that few students, who attended the programme then, brought to the notice of elders and school about the problem of eve teasing in their area and which was resolved by timely intervention from Area Suraksha Mitra Sathish, school members and  Police.

School staff mentioned that the students have gained confidence and have been guided to approach the problem in right way during the awareness programme.

Do read and spread the message on importance of conducting such awareness programmes.

Hi BCP, along the stretch of Banaswadi Main Road from Jai Bharath Nagar all the way to Maruti Sevanagar, shop keepers on the left of the road have invaded onto the footpath. The footpaths in these areas are just about 4-5 feet wide and most of these shops seem to have occupied half the space. It gets for pedestrians to use the footpath. Even more when there are pedestrians walking on the opposite direction. Can the shopkeepers be mandated to use only their property for business and not beyond? 
Sorry for my previous post that was happened by me and that will not happen in future and my sincere apologies for this problem, and  accepted my apologies. @

Hi, 
Please do not block the right turn from Manyata tech Park Gate 2 (towards hebbal). It is causing a huge traffic jam. Worse than when the right turn was free. We spend almost 20 mins to just take the U-turn and go towards hebbal.
What can be done is block it in the morning time and release it in the evening. Or please do not block it at all it was much better last time.

Dear BENGALURU CITY POLICE. Of late you seem to be taking up important issues, especially regarding traffic. Please also seriously
take up the implementation of the ban on public smoking. It is common sight to see people smoking in public and most of these smokers do not have any sensitivity to the people around who would also be paying a huge price for no fault of theirs. Many of the smokers are also rude to requests of non-smokers. Their refrain normally is that it is a public place and no one has a right to question them. Just look around and you would see huge crowds in front of all small shops that sell cigarettes.

Hello sirs/madam,

There is this insensitive person who frequents a restaurant near our home. He smokes right out in a public place and doesn't stop when when asked to. He first tried to say what he was smoking was not a cigarette. Then claimed he has been to the u.s. and has smoked there. Can anybody advice me on how I get this person to stop? 

Also request anybody who sees this image to share this on your timeline so that if this person is on Facebook it can reach him and his near ones.

I checked with the restaurant management and they say they cannot do much as he is someone known to the owner of this layout.

Comparative account of Indian police per lac of population. Another important factor which needs to be sorted out. 
Some people are trying to steal bikes and in the process damaging the bikes at the public parking under hebbal flyover (beside the K2 bus stop on the police station side). Stealing petrol was there sometimes, but recently they are trying to remove wiring and trying to break the locks. Some of my friends faced this last week and i faced it today evening. The police station is not far from this parking lot and still such event are happening.  Can something be done about this?

In all Companies

Make Parking Fee 5000 per car per Month
2000 per Bike Per Month
200 per car per day and 100 per bike per day
Free company transportation

by this at least 50% of people will stop travelling by car/bike. 
Dear Bengaluru City Police, foothpath vendors have illegally occupied the complete stretch opposite to iGATE in EPIP 2nd phase, Whitefield. As a result of this, it is very difficult to walk on the footpath eventually it obstructs the traffic. They have made the place so dirty as well. Please take some action regarding this. 
 DO NOT BLOCK 'FREE LEFT TURN' AT SIGNALS. 
Always make way for the vehicles which want to take free left turn at signals. This is the road rule & commuters discipline. 
Be a sensible road user.
I am really thankful to Bengaluru traffic police for making ngef signal; old madras road signal free; infact very much.. Everyday I was getting held up in the signal for more than 20 minutes at around 8 pm.. Since this Monday we never get held up there, since the traffic from kasturi nagar that joins to the signal has been diverted. . Whosoevers idea it was; I am really thankful to them

respected sir just want to know when ever we park our vehicle we pay parking fee and there will be mentioned on the ticket PARKING AT OWNERS RISK then why should we pay & park our vehicles if they are charging then there should be some security for our vehicle in this manner there will be less vehicle theft because without parking ticket you cannot take your vehicle and robbers will find it difficult to do it and the parking owners will have to take strick action if the vehicle is taken without producing parking ticket  HOPE THIS WILL BE SOME USEFUL TO SOME BANGALOREANS

Dear Team

I live in #37,1st Cross, 2nd Main, Cambridge Layout, Ulsoor, BLR -8,
We live in the last house which is just near the Main Channel and there is this ISRO SLUM. They are a huge trouble for us, as they come near our house (where is there is a empty corner area) sit and take drugs, smoke and drink in the night times. If we ask them something they try to use all kinds of abusive language even on women and try to hit my father and husband. 

This is a every day problem for us these days. Last night we had the same kind of problem when called Ulsoor Police Station they disconnected the call by saying that part of the area belongs to Indiranagar Police Station.

By the time we reach 100 and ask them to send someone. They all do things which we cant explain run inside the Slum and hide themselves.

All of us in this area have off-street parking. They all have so many vehicles that we cannot park our vehicles at all. Even for that we have to struggle fight and do all kinds of things.

We normally dont get any support from anyone atleast in this forum I hope to get some kind of support.

My Father is retired HAL Employee and is 67years old. He is Diabetic and very weak. Mother is just a house wife.

I am more concerned about my parents and children as they dont have anyone for support. I am the only child married, but both my husband and myself work and return back home very late.

Please, help us get ride these problems. I had to write all the problems hence a very long post.

I Lost my office Laptop with Bag on inner Ring Road near Embassy Golf Links at 5:15PM IST on  10th Aug and was raining at the time. I have visited two police stations nearby and was not ready to book complaint because of Jurisdiction and were pointing me to different police station. Finally I got to correct police station, Halasur. But Halasur police is asking me to provide company video footage (to prove that I came out with bag from office) to book complaint. But they do neither ready to take complaint nor ready to check my company video footage to investigate before taking cognizance of the crime. This is very absurd  reply instead showing sympathy and help aggrieved. 

I spoke to my company officials and are ready to provide Video Footage. I am posting on your page to seek help from Police officials.

#OnlineSafety : The Internet generally offers great opportunities for children to learn and play, there are some areas of cyberspace that are not appropriate. Parents need to ensure children are actively supervised when using the Internet, particularly time spent chatting online.

Steps for improving your child's safety

Be aware of the programs and files children use.
Consider installing filtering software on computers used by young people.
Be aware of the programs and files that are on your family's computers.
Place the computer in a public area of the home, such as a living room.
Ensure you are able to access your child's email and randomly check the contents.
Check your phone bill for unusual outgoing calls or consider using a 'caller ID' device to identify incoming calls.
Discuss online safety with your child's school, public library or anywhere that you believe your child accesses the Internet.
Make sure children are aware of some of the issues involved with spending time on the Internet.
Show children what sites they can go to and what information they can send out.
Sit down with your children and discuss the issues. 
#INTERNETSCAMS :  Avoid common scams encountered on malicious web sites & those sent through fraudulent e-mails [known as phishing] such as:

Two Constables from Commercial Street Poice Station were on there regular beat rounds and they managed to save an Activa on spot as it was not locked...

A guy was sitting on the bike and trying to steal it as he saw the two constables he quickly ran away..

Due to the sound of the constables conversation just peeped out and the constables happened to take the bike to Commercial Street PS for security reasons, spoke to them and locked the vehicle.

Requested them to wait so i can take a picture and post it but they were not ready to a picture...
Upon requesting many times one of the cop happened to day his name as "Manu"....

Really appreciate the hard work of the two constables and there politeness, would request the authorities to send a letter of thank you on behalf of me.

Thank You

 #SuccessStory @ichangemycity

Be it contributing actively for community safety or in kind for efficiently conducting the awareness programmes, our Area Suraksha Mitras (ASM) are doing their best. Currently we have 291 ASMs as part of community policing team.

We are glad to share the two recent success stories, wherein in Banaswadi ASM Jude Rajesh Ferrao on 31st July, brought to notice of the cops about nuisance created by drunkards in the area and one who was in deep slumber in the Santro Car and one lay wayside, this was disturbing the residents . Jude Rajesh posted the photos in the whatsapp group meant for the team and  brought this to the notice of cops, who immediately arrived at the spot & took the drunkards to the station.

ASM Vasu donated an amplifier to Madivala Police station on 10th August, which will be helpful during the conduct of awareness programmes to a large gathering.

Join us in encouraging and spreading the good work done by ASMs (y).

 Kudos to BTP for finding a solution to the ever lasting traffic problem at NGEF junction. Hope the solution lasts for ever :) My travel time was reduced by half today. Normally I end up waiting at the signal for 20 minutes, today my entire journey took just 20 minutes! 
Also request you to increase the height of median on old madras road to prevent two wheelers from taking indiscriminate u-turns.

Dear BTP,

Kindly recognize the traffic hurdle at Bommanahalli signal, From any side to and fro, It at-least takes an hour during peak hours.While reason being local moving traffic, While forgetting the major traffic is going straight.

Here is the possible solution : 
By implementing the Dividers that assist the vehicles going straight.
while vehicles to turn to right/left need to be FORCED on the correct lane.
Imp* : Need to provide a constricted lane for the forwarding traffic. 

Simply by common sense it is possible to resolve with minimum efforts. But lack of interest seems evident here! 

Get back to me if u need help 
Sir,

The 19th cross, 6th phase, J.P.Nagar from 33rd main that is from guru bar and restaurant to srinivasa nursery has become a hell It is dead end and at 33rd main junction itself the autorikshaws totally block the road, In case if we are lucky we cannot even think of crossing guru bar. Forget about the vehicles, even walking is a nightmare. Added to that the cigrate  shop attached to the guru bar will have a dozen of people smoking openly. Last time when we called the J.P.Nagar police, the ASI who came in a jeep reprimanded the residents saying that it is only a parking problem. We are fed up. 
Today morning around 10 am, when my daughter took out her Honda amaze car to go to the office, on tempo trax hoisting a political party flag had blocked the entire road in front of guru bar and when my daughter asked them to give the way. The have abused her in singular and have asked her to go and complain to any body she dares to complain. And they have stared at her indecently. 

We do not know what to do. We cannot vacate the place also as most of us are still paying housing loan and no body dare to buy a house in our apartment. 

I really doubt that whether we are living in a democratic country or in a terrorist infested place. 

Added to all these there is an unauthorized flag post covering one third of the the road, that is always surrounded by autorikshaw drivers about whom it is better not to mention also. They synonym with goondas

Hope at least our plight will catch a responsible officers attention

Oh god save us.

 TRAFFIC AT 7.30 PM on Sanky tanky road, Victoria road, Dairy circle on BG road.
Dear Sir,

I would like to bring an incident to your attention that happened with me yesterday.

Place: Outside Krishnarajapuram (K R Puram) railway station (Old madras road side)
Date & Time: 9th Aug 2015 (Sunday) around 12.30 pm
Traffic police I interacted with: Mr. Siddegowda ST (K R Puram police station)

I went to pick up my family coming from Chennai. I reached there by around 12 pm. There were plenty of cars (at least 20 taxi and private cars) parked outside the station and the parking fee collector directed me to park my car in the same row. I saw him directing other cars and collect parking fee from them. I too paid Rs.30/- as parking fee and got a receipt.

Later, I came back to the parking area with my family (around 12.30 pm). I could see most of the cars parked around mine were missing and there was a traffic cop talking to some car owners. Puzzled, I went near my car when the traffic cop (Mr. Siddegowda ST) came and demanded a fine of Rs.100/- for parking in a no parking zone!

I was totally confused at this point and showed the parking fee receipt to the cop. He looked at the receipt and immediately replied that those people wanted money so they took it and went away and that if I have any issues, I should go to the police station and complain. But in any case, I will have to pay him the fine.

I tried to reason with Mr. Siddegowda ST but he wouldn't budge. He did not give me any valid response other than telling me that I am an educated man so I should not have parked in a no parking zone and that if I have any complaints I should go to the police station and complain! I finally paid the fine of Rs.100/- and got the receipt.

Now, following are the points I made to Mr. Siddegowda ST and I would like to raise the same with the Bangalore traffic police department. He could not give me any convincing answers I hope at least you will:

Point 1: Is the entire incident staged? 
 Scene 1: Some people taking charge, posing as parking fee collectors and organize the parking in a no-parking zone just before the train arrives. 
 Scene 2: The parking area is full, they vanish from the scene. 
 Scene 3: Moments later, after the train arrives, traffic police appear from no-where and start issuing no-parking tickets. 

Things became obvious to me later. The police controlling traffic at the junction could NOT have missed the action of so many cars being invited to park at a no-parking zone. Did they simply choose to turn a blind eye?! If they were really duty conscious, why didn't they take matter into their hands then and there rather than wait for the entire space to be filled up and then start issuing tickets? 
Therefore, I seriously doubt the involvement of traffic police too in what looks like an organized broad-day-light-cheating of the public! Isn't this a nexus between the traffic police and the so called parking fee collectors? Why would the department allow their personnel to make some quick money by cheating the public? Is it not your duty to prevent a crime when you have the chance rather than take action once its done?

Point 2: I am a law abiding citizen:
 I pay my taxes on time. 
 My car is a Kerala registered vehicle. But since I use it in Bangalore, I have paid a hefty road tax (KA) here as well. 
 I always buy platform tickets even in stations where it is not usually checked. 
 Even after all the arguments I had with Mr. Siddegowda ST, I paid him the no-parking fine because I knew I was at fault too. I should perhaps have noticed the no-parking sign and not parked there at all. BUT, I urge the authorities to think from a common man's perspective. It is easy for anyone to miss/ignore the no-parking sign when you are being invited to what looks like a parking lot by people posing themselves as a parking fee collectors, when there are plenty of cars being parked already. 
 I am sure there are many Indians in this city, like me. Is it too much to expect some reciprocation, some honesty and responsibility from the authorities as well?

I request the Bangalore traffic police to look into the matter take necessary action against the people involved, to prevent these kinds of unwanted incidents in future.

Kind regards,
Suresh K

Dear Bengaluru City Police,

Today My wife got a call from the number "8746007598" as some aircel customer care to offer sim card.

My wife told that she is docomo customer please see the number and call. But the lady other side was very rash and she told that she knows that just tell you want or not. 

She also use bad word about my wife mother and told to keep the phone with slang. My wife is so hurt by heart and now wanted to change her phone number as she is getting these advertising call and talks rashly too.

I don't want to tell the bad words she used. This made her feel very bad and crying.

Please call them and give some advice from your side. Also advice us how to stop these calls.

Sir,

Below is a reproduced fb post on one of the incident happened today. Request you to please take action on the same.

ARE WE BEING EXPLOITED???

Hi friends,

This is Mastan and Srinivas, normal citizens of India leading our life with everyday struggles to meet basic things even in the 21st century.

We are here to share one of the disturbing incident which most of us come across every day or the other, still forget and go on....

We went to Majestic (KSRTC Terminal  3 Bengaluru) to receive parents (of srinivas) on 09.08.2015 around 5:00 PM. We were waiting for the bus to arrive and thought of taking a soft drink (sprite). The MRP was Rs. 34. Whereas the shopkeeper demanded Rs. 40. We questioned why the extra charge over and above MRP. The shopkeeper refused to answer us. LIKE MOST OF OUR FELLOW INDIANS WE HAD GONE AHEAD BY PAYING THE AMOUNT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH. Casually, we had checked the same with another shop in Bus stand and was not surprised to know the same rate as earlier one.

Here the incident happens. We then went to a nandini outlet in the same Bus stand to purchase Milk Peda. The MRP was Rs. 80 and the shopkeeper demanded Rs. 85 not to our surprise. This time we questioned what is the basis of price, rate card, permission letter for sale of high price. The shopkeeper in a rough tone (In local language Kannada) replied nothing is there and take at price whatever we sell or leave from this place. We again questioned you dont have any right to sell at an unauthorized price and kept on our stand. This time the GUNDA angle in him came out shouting at us. He even took a Rs. 100 note and challenged to buy a single product at MRP in the any of the outlet in all 3 KSRTC terminals of Majestic. We were surprised to know that the DANDA happens in a syndicate and no one is afraid of any rule or regulation. The situation heated up and the shopkeeper challenged us to do whatever we want. They started calling their fellow members to threaten us. We took the photographs of the outlet and person and left from the place. 

The message here is targeted to those like us who internally feel Why is it like this?? and then with a Ufffff.. forget and go on to avoid any issue, for we are so afraid (ARE WE REALLY AFRAID??) and Chalta hai.. attitude. This has been taken advantageously by many great people like those in Bus stands, auto drivers, Petrol Bunks, Bus Conductors, Provisional stores and list goes on without limit in our country. Unless we change our attitude and question, all these smart people shall continue to make us fools.

Just think over the incident that happened to us. We can draw following inferences.
1.All the outlets in Bus stands of Majestic area sell products at rate more than MRP. It is syndicate network of shopkeepers selling Items at an unauthorized price.
2.Shopkeepers are not even afraid of any authority. This hints at possible involvement of concerned officials in the activity.
3.This is something happening very openly for a long time without regulation. Thus this can also be seen as a failure of Vigilance of KSRTC and other regulatory authorities (Knowingly or unknowingly).
4.We may feel what are we losing by paying an extra pie???? But we are forgetting how much we are being exploited indirectly. Just see below a small statistics on this.
a.The average extra money charged over MRP : 20-25%.
b. As per 2009 statistics, approx passenger flow in Majestic per 
day: 1.62 L 
c. Number of passengers who make a purchase (say 60% of 
people): 0.97 L
d. Spending per passenger (say): Rs. 50.
e. Total spending of passengers per day in Majestic: Rs. 48.6 L
f. Extra money spent over MRP per day (20% and 
unaccounted): Rs. 9.72 L
g. Extra money spent over MRP per year (20% and 
unaccounted): Rs. 35.48 Crores
Where is this unaccounted money going??????????

5. The above is a small example of a small shops in one Bus stand of Bengaluru. Just imagine the expanse of unaccounted money in various fields in the whole country. Now we can pretty be sure why the price of commodities are shooting up, real estate prices are sky rocketing. 
6. The net effect is nothing is in his reach to buy for a normal citizen leading his day today life.

So friends, should we allow all these people to exploit us????? Please do not pay an extra rupee over what is supposed to be. Let us question all such acts in a GANDHIAN manner. We are not so optimistic that some immediate miracle would happen. But we believe that every drop makes Ocean. Let us raise our voice to all such things. In a broader perspective, Let all such noble acts brings a day where we stop fantasizing about western developed countries and the reverse happens.

And finally, please do not stop with just reading, which will make our effort in bringing it to you and your time in reading shall be worthless.

JAI HIND.....

Dear Sir,

Few mins back I got a call from +91 7261 071 715 this number who spoke to me in Hindi and introduced them self as bank officers and asked me if you are using Debit card. I got to know that they are cheaters but still i continued to speak to them to check what all information they may ask. They first told your card has been blocked and if you want it open please confirm your 16 digit card number, expiry date & cvv number. I just disconnected the call scolding them not to cheat anyone like this. However, I know they will try to fool others in same way and if it work they will cheat them. Hence, I am requesting you to take some action on these people.

Thanks,

I am very ashamed to say that the constitution of India is so worst. We all are Indian but we don't act like one. Bengaluru Police will treat north Indians like a terrorist. They do not listen to us and they will do whatever they want. They are hired for public service not screw public happiness. Yesterday night i was with my cousin brother's, they have come from Lucknow to see the beauty of South India and we were near to our home roaming on bike. Police caught us near to Yeshwantpur and they tried to check weather we are drunk or not and we were actually not. Then they asked for Driving license which i was not having. They asked me to pay money to them, i said give me receipt for it they started saying you are misbehaving with so asking for a correct thing is everyone's wright same i did. Then they got to know that i will not pay bribe they said we are seizing  your vehicle. We will give you receipt, collect it from court, i asked them there is no point in seizing my vehicle then they said we can do whatever we want and they took it to Yeswantpur station and there they filled 7 case on me and inspector there is saying put some more case on him, we will see how he will take his vehicle.
 I never expected this from a traffic police man, i am very ashmaed on myself that why i have come to Bengaluru to work.
I have never misbehaved with him and i just ignored to pay him bribe that was my fault.
If someone with soft heart is there please help me out how to get rid of this.

3yr Child kills himself by mistake !!!!!

Dear All,
Please share this with your known people, to avoid this type of accidents.
A tragic and horrific scene took place in Jubail, as a child killed himself by mistake while he was in his father's car. The father, who forgot to switch off the vehicle, headed for the grocery store for a few minutes and left the child inside.

When he returned, he was shocked to see his 3 year old son had his head stuck out the window; the child who had stuck his head out the window to look outside, accidentally had one of his knees pressed on the button and raised the glass.

He could not lower the window, which completely overpowered the neck to the fullest extent. The father rushed hysterically to lower the window, only to find the child was dead and lifeless. All who witnessed the incident cried out in sadness and pain.

Unfortunate incidents of child sexual offence across the country, there is some sought of fear writ large in children and parents alike. Thereby it has become very important to conduct the awareness programmes and restore the confidence in all.

During the awareness programme it is nice to see children coming forward to clarify their doubts and their face lights up with confidence. 

Do you agree that each and every school should conduct the awareness programmes on child sexual offence??

 Dear Road Users,
This video is to show how careless we can be on the road and risk our lives by certain distractions such as using our cellphones while driving or even crossing the road. 
Watch &  Stay safe.
You take so much effort and pain to catch the thieves, chain snatchers etc. but they come out on bail and continue the offence. All your efforts go waste. Can you not work with the Judiciary, the Law makers and prevent this occurrence? 
the recent instant in the school is one more warning bell for us. The police does not have manpower to check each and every school in city. make schools to imm PTM & ask them to put the staff detail in web it will give much better result. most of the schools not allowing the parents to get in to the school, if parents bigup their ward in the classroom they will get one to one with the teacher and other staff they will pass the small information also to the parents.

Hi Team, I understand police checking in localities in the night, but whats with the police stopping professionals only to question them for long hours , asking for vehicle documents and telling that we have to come to the station ? Is the police not capable to judge between a thief and someone just dropping their friend and going back home ? + the way the two policemen came in front of us in their bike to stop us, we felt there were some burglars and actually fled, when we looked back it was the cops.  - this incident happened in the area near maharaja signal (Koramangala). People are afraid of the police but for the wrong reasons. 
Sir,

Sir, 
On the route to Old Baiyappanahalli railway gate from Banaswadi flyover, most of the days while travelling in the morning I notice a handicapped person on his wheel chair moving on the middle of the road in a zigzag manner or he just stays in the middle of the road. He looks severely sick and mentally ill. Some times he will be found before the first railway crossing or sometimes after that and before the main railway gate. This is posing a great risk to both the person and the commuters as sometimes he will be in the middle of the road just after a turn. I found people end up sudden braking to avoid hitting him. I am sure locals there may be knowing his whereabouts. I request you to direct the concerned authorities to look after this issue before something unwanted incident happens.
 
Thanks

The Police Commissioner,

   Today while returning from a movie I happened to see a very painful scene which really touched my heart. That is reason I decided to make this post. 
   Today I saw that few police men were taking money from cycle Chaiwala on roadside. Its really sad that The Indian Government is paying so less to our policemen that they need to take money from even Chaiwala, who themselves obviously have financial commitments due to which they need to work whole night selling Chai to earn a living. 
   It is really sad that our hardworking policemen have reached to such level of financial crisis that they are having to take such steps to earn a living. I sincerely request you to take immediate action to increase the salary of the Bangalore police force so that they will not have to take such steps of taking money from Chaiwala for a living.

Sir she is insulting our India 
I wish to state the below mentioned points, describing the problem faced by me - 
1) We moved in to a flat in Electronic City in September 2014 
2) We had paid the security deposit to the landlord
3) The rental agreement of the flat was deliberately delayed by the landlord and was never executed by him despite of several reminders.
4) After 7 months of stay, the landlord demanded the rent to be increased by 45%. 
5) We disagreed to continue any further with this condition and finally vacated the flat on 3 June 2015.
6) We tried calling the Landlord multiple times after vacating the flat but out calls went unanswered. So we sent an SMS confirming that we have vacated the flat. But we never received any response. 
7) After multiple calls for multiple days, he finally collected the keys on 12th June 2015. 
8) He had returned one third of the deposit amount after making many deductions, which wasn't agreed upon earlier (Even he made deductions for the rent correction for 2 months). 
9) He has not returned the remaining amount yet and instead of returning the amount, he has threatened us, asking us to pay the rent for 12 extra days rent
10) When we refused the payment and asked him to refund the deposit, he threatened to send some men to my current flat and "SEE ME". His exact words were "I KNOW HOW TO GET MY MONEY FROM YOU. I'LL SEND MY MEN TO YOUR FLAT."

I only have the e-Mails as proof and that it has been over 2 months of vacating the flat. I am yet to get my money and have been threatened by the flat owner. Please suggest what legal action can be taken by me? 
We working in government of karnataka, we have served the department with atmost sincerity and honesty, as we had no public contacts. We bought a site in Kodigehalli in1991.Recently some fellow by crating bogus records he is trying to sell our site.It is hardened money, i donpt what todo.

Social media is abuzz with discussions on clashes that broke out between a group of protestors and police outside a school in Bengaluru. Allegations are flying high against Bengaluru City Police for 'forcefully evicting' protestors from outside the school. Some of them even going on to the extent of saying that the protestors were targeted because they were north-east Indians. That has to be the most atrocious way to look at this incident. Yes, the police asked the agitators to leave from the spot because, it is a violation of POCSO and a punishable offence if any person/persons reveal directly or indirectly the identity of the child/children. Protesting outside the school will amount to indirectly giving leads to the identity of the child. The Bengaluru City Police have been extremely careful while handling POCSO cases, not even entering schools in uniform, restraining the media from giving out specific details and ensuring absolute secrecy when it comes to the identity of the child and his/her family. Let's remember in this case that a security guard was arrested within hours of a complaint. But protests however, went on.  When the protestors refused to leave the spot even after explaining to them the violation of POCSO act, the police had to use force. This is when all hell broke loose. An eyewitness, who had come there to take part in the protest, who was in no way connected to the police, told me on record that a couple of protestors started hitting and pushing the police and pelted stones at them. The situation was getting out of control and the police had to resort to mild baton charge to disperse the crowd. The protestors started running amok, bringing traffic to a standstill. Let's remember that police are human too, it is a crime to assault a public servant on duty. The protestors claimed that the police started a baton charge without provocation. Protestors speaking to me said they had gathered for a peaceful protest demanding answers from the school, some of them were aware that it was a violation on POCSO but they went ahead with the protest. They do not deny the fact that the police first requested them to vacate the place but they refused because they wanted shcool authorities to talk to them. Not one of the protestors there said that the police targeted them because they were north-east Indians. Who floated this theory? This was just another protest that went haywire, is there a need to give it a regionalist colour?

It's unbelievable that Bangalore Police joined lumpen elements in thrashing people protesting the rape of a child in a school in Indiranagar.  It appears the protestors were targeted because they were from the North East of India.  Did not realise some of the Bangalore Police are so racist and can be so inhuman, that they thrash those gathered to protest the rape of a child, and that because they are from the North East of India.

Thank you so much... 
Dear Team.
.as per the trafic rules. ..no bus stops should be allowed immediately next to signal. .

It has been seen trafic police are allowing all private buses and BMTC buses to stop infront of Taj Vivanta tumkur road..
I have seen almost 10 to 15 times...many ambulance are getting delayed to reach coulmbia asia hospital located at yeshwantpur because of this.
There is a specific place next to RNS motars with wide road for bus stop..why its not getting implemented. .??
Pls rectify and alert the official to take action 
I have been living in Bengaluru for past 3 years and have come across various campaigns done both for auto drivers as well as commuters for charging and paying as per the meter rates. Despite of all these I have seen very little change in behaviour of most of the auto drivers across the city right from areas like Sadashivnagar, Richmond circle & Malleshwaram to outer parts of city like Yelahanka. In the mid day light they negotiate for fares to be paid over and above the meter rates. Rs. 13 per km is in no way less compared to the fares in any other metro or even in comparision to cab rates. In past couple of weeks, I have tried to board an auto at NES bus stop almost twice. None of the auto driver was ready to come as per meter at 8:30 pm. Irony is Yelahanka police station is hardly 500 mts from the bus stop and still auto drivers openly claim that no one would come by meter. They were demanding almost Rs. 100/- for a distance less than 2.5 km. It's the same at Yelahanka railway station, Anantapura, Yelahanka and Attur as well. Auto drivers are taking common man for a ride. As a common man living in Bengaluru, I wish to know when will this situation change for betterment of all commuters?

I must say, that our city needs Police Officers like, Sub Inspectors Gurikar (Koramangala Police Station). The approach of this officer certainly makes the citizen feel that the Police are for protecting us. The courtesy, empathy and proactive approach of this officer is what needs to be with every officer. It will make the Police Force of our City more Citizen Friendly.

Ten awareness programmes were conducted across Banaswadi, Jnanabharathi and Yelahanka Police stations limits on 3rd August.

Nearly 150 citizens were empowered on various crime safety issues. The topics discussed were on abandoned vehicles, attention diversion thefts, mobile phone thefts and chain snatching thefts.

We would like to hear from you. Let us know if you have been part of any of the awareness programmes.
Drunk driving is a major cause of accidents in India
There are many causes of or road accidents (which are very high in India as compared to other countries) but a major cause is drunken driving.
Drunk drivers are more liable to make errors and more liable to get into a rage and drive rashly. Drunk drivers may be excellent drivers otherwise, but It is a proven fact that peoples personalities change when drunk. People get more aggressive. Research in the West has proven this, that drunk drivers exhibit aggressive driving behavior like going too close to the vehicle in front of them and applying more force when breaking. They are also become more reckless, unable to see the consequences of their actions.
The news is that the government is proposing to confiscate the licence of anyone who fails the breath analyser test. Thats good news. Right now the penalty of drunken driving in India is a fine of Rs 2000-3000 and a prison term ranging from six months to two years. However, as conviction takes time, the driver can be back on the road the very next day as it is a bailable offence. In fact, the driving licences of all those who drive recklessly should be confiscated. Even if one kills people on the road one can get bail. And if one is powerful enough, get away without any punishment.
India has one of the highest accident rates but one of the lowest conviction rates. Just take Maharashtra. In 2005, 214 criminal cases were lodged for causing death by negligence by driving, but the conviction rate was only 9 per cent. Court delays make it easy for witnesses to disappear, or hostile. It is easy for the convicted (who are out on bail) to bribe witnesses.
Also, punishment for drunken driving is light. Under the Motor Vehicles Act you get a six month prision sentence or a fine of Rs 2000/- but hardly anyone ever goes to prison as Rs 2000/- is a paltry sum. Interestingly, like many other laws in our country our laws governing drunken driving are ancient. They date back to the nineteenth century! A time where people used to travel by horse driven carriages!
And at times culprits get away when police attempt to charge (in the absence of a suitable law) the driver under the law of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304-II of the Indian Penal Code) but proving this charge is almost impossible as the prosecution has to show that the driver had the intention to kill. Our driving laws are antiquated, from the time when there were hardly any cars on the road!

Respected Sir,

I am not sure if this is the correct platform to put this on. If not can you guide this to proper channel.
I stay near JP Park Mathikere, Last evening around 7:50 when i was walking from Muthyalanagar towards JP park, 3 guys on bike came from behind and tried to snatch my phone and Chain. The guy in the middle tried to snatch and the last guy was holding him so that he does not fall. The guys we around 20 or less than that in age. I tried to catch them and cried out "Kalla Kalla" but could catch them as they escaped. I couldn't even note the number plate as i was running towards them to catch. I did not lose anything last night, but we need to make sure this does not happen in future. This happened not in the main road but the road where I-MART is there.
This road will be empty with less people,  These guys look like new into these kind of robbery, so keeping an eye will make people walk safely on the road.

I will definitely search for these guys!!! 

Thanks,
Krishna

BENGALURU CITY POLICE Bengaluru Traffic Police
Can any normal(brown) police stop us just to check documents even if we have not violeted any traffic rules? ? 
The residents of 10th B Main Road in Jayanagar 3rd Block are inconvenienced by smokers who regularly occupy the passage next to a showroom here, connecting 11th Main and 10th B Main. Owing to this, residents have become passive smokers. The problem starts right from 9 am and continues beyond 11 pm. In spite of our repeated requests, people continue to smoke here. We request the authorities concerned to look into the matter. 
Last evening when I was returning with 2 of my friends in my car, I had one of the worst encounters with a BMTC bus driver and the conductor of that bus(K A 0 1 F A 923, route number 213 L). The bus driver overtook us from the left side so recklessly and that left scratches in the front  of the car, near the headlight. When I stopped and questioned him regarding the way he spoke , the driver straightway started addressing me in singular and used fowl language. Since I am also a localite I was to an extent able to argue and give him back few sentences but not as cheap as he spoke. A few minutes later, the conductor of that bus who had no clear picture as to what has happened, got down from the bus, started abusing us with all the Kannada slang and even "threatened " to break our car glass and physically abuse us. After this we wasted no time in immediately capturing a picture of the bus with its registration number. I called up 100 and was guided to go to Kumarsawamy police station and also the traffic police immediately sent flash messages. I have to admit that Mr. Nagesh V, who is the sub inspector there, gave us complete assurance that these people will be taken to task. In less than 24 hours of me filing an FIR , I got a call by Mr. Nagesh saying he has both of them in the custody. I was mightily impressed with his efficiency. Both the driver and conductor were taken to task, they pleaded to be forgiven with folded arms. I think this has taught them a lesson that they cannot take women as lightly as they used to just 24 hours ago. 

Kudos to Mr.Nagesh and his team for their sincerity and efficiency ! 
Please help me back my camera. This is my story I have posted on Ola Cabs page, they told they will give the driver's details but till now they didn't give anything. Till now nothing happen, the driver didn't come to Police Station. I just don't know what to do.

Dear BCP authority,
This is to bring to your kind attention regarding issues the residents are facing on daily basis in Someshwara temple street (Ward 90, D II Street) , Next to Someshwara Temple, Ulsoor- Bangalore 08.

Please review the pictures highlighting the following issues:
1) Vehicles illegally parked on the road: Temple visitors and others leave their vehicles parked on our roads unattended for long periods in between the road regularly, disrupting movement of resident vehicles. I have called up Ulsoor police station and control room numerous times requesting to tow the vehicles as it is blocking the road but was appalled with the pathetic response and refusal to assist us stating they "do not have towing service in Ulsoor" and I need to "adjust" and wait till the vehicles are removed by the owners themselves. I have elderly parents and grandmother requiring medical assistance from time to time, due the nuisance of vehicles parked and blocking our road, we have had to hire taxis to take them to the hospital inspite of having vehicles of our own on numerous occassions. 

2) Public road blocked - The above mentioned road has been restricted access by the temple authorities intentionally without relevant approval or permission. The big slab lying on the road is blocking visitors and general public from using public road since over 2 months now. Due to the road being blocked, all the visitors to the temple are parking in front of our houses as it appears as a dead end to them. 

3)Unauthorized road digging - This road has been dug up and left as shown in the pictures over 20 days now by the Someshwara temple authorities, inspite of repeated requests and being a regular visitors to the temple ourselves, the issue has not been solved still. The temple authorities do not seem to co-operate and we are facing inconvenience to the highest extent day in and day out. We are unable to take our 4 wheeler or 2 wheeler vehicles outside nor get it back into the house due to this.

I kindly request the relevant authorities to take up this matter seriously and assist us in resolving this issue which has greatly inconvenienced residents of this area. I also request the relevant authorities to kindly put up "No Parking" boards on this street or barricades to deter visitors from parking illegally.

I thought there is a difference between no parking sign and no stop sign becoz yesterday near to ulsoor lake when I stop the car at no parking sign police has taken the photo but when I asked I am there in the car this is not a on stopping sign but police not replied any thing he just moved and some police they will remove the air directly without informing  to the driver. 
I live in HSR sector (25th Main Rd). There is a mosque nearby where the muzim begins to loudly chant on the loudspeaker at 5 am everyday. It's extremely disturbing as we can't sleep beyond 5 am. While I am very tolerant toward the traditions of various religious groups, the usage of loudspeakers at 5 am is a bit inconsiderate. Can you please request groups to start their loudspeaker activities after 6 am ?

Hi,

I would want to complaint about the auto driver with whom i had a tiff in the morning.Not only he argued ,he asked for extra money & denied not going to the destination if i i don't pay extra.As i don't have a smart phone hence couldn't take a picture of his vehicle registration number.However i had noted down his details which are : Name - KANAKARAJ, DL NO. 20030007325, BADGE NO. 14913. Hope that with these details you would be able to catch hold of this guy & give him a learning to behave properly with the customer & not overcharge.This is a daily nuisance in bangalore.If i go out daily i have such arguments & overcharging everyday.Please do something about this.Because of him i got late to my office & spoilt my day first thing in the morning.Hoping to hear from you soon.

good morning 
Dear Bengaluru City Police

Today around 5pm at Teachers Colony,HSR Extension while I was heading towards HSR BDA bus stop, I have experienced a horrible incident of eve teasing by this guy in the bike. During my way from home (Venkatapura) till bus stop this idiot eve teaser was stalking me many a times.Though it was in day light still i was shocked to see his courage. He had passed nasty ,vulgar comments on me. When i raised voice he didn't stop and dared to follow me and said many unparliamentary words and absolute intolerable vulgar comments. Since i was scared like hell to take his picture I have some how managed to take the picture of his bike from backside. I am in utter shocked thinking if these stalkers can dare in such a day light and roam freely ,there is every possibility they can go to any extent. I request Blore Dept to help me out and to all other ladies who go through these tortures every day. I hope this picture of his Bike(Black Pulsar) will help you to capture him and give the necessary punishments.

Dear Friends, We have crossed #75k followers #GreatDevelopment !! way to go !! @CPBlr 
Respected Sir. 

My name is Emmanuel Paul. I was eating dinner with my brother and business partners at Guru Garden at Gottigere. We recieved the bill at 11.23 abd were stepping out at 11.30 pm and as we were walking out two police constables and an inspector by the name Vijay, gottigere or Hulimavu hit myself and two other friends with the lathi. One of the has damage on his bone and I have a big scar on my upper thigh. To my shock it didn't stop. He muscled my brother and me again. I had to calm him down and drive away to safety.

Firstly I am hurt that I have become a victim of this rumour which is a hard hitting fact. 
Secondly I do not understand who gave him the right to hit me and on what basis. 
I have photos and videos of the situation.

I demand stern action against these law breaking policemen or an apology on my face for this disgracefully behaviour. I have faith in the police system and I hope the truth is not hidden and written away. Please let me know how I can be of help. 

I am unable to send you the pics as there are issues on my phone.
Ps. I have escalated this matter to respected ACP -B.N Oblesh and I am confident that this matter will be taken seriously.
Jeep details: Ka02 G 756

Please advice. 
Awaiting your response.

I need help to for my family .. 
Sir

I just received a call from +919083078209 at 9.51am from a person whose accent  is from Delhi.

He was claiming to be speaking from RBI Bangalore and asking for ATM details.

When I asked him where RBI is located he disconnected the phone.

If possible track him down and you may break the big mafia cheating hundreds of citizens across the nation. 
Thank you M N Reddy sir. You owe the credit to link Bangalore police with the citizen 's on the social media platforms. This has definitely helped in ease to approach police !!! Immediate updates on happenings!! Avoid rumours from news channels !!! Thank you so much !! Hope the inititiative take one step ahead under the new leadership.
