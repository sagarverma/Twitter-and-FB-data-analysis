Dear Sir,
                My name is Ravi shankar.  On 17th Jan 2015 When I was at my home @ 7:30pm. 3 men entered my house saying they were from Police Central Branch Crime squad.

They started questioning me saying that I am dealing in fake currency notes and they have got information about me. In the process 1 person also assaulted me. 

I didn't know what to do since they told they were from Police department. After questioning me for a long time they took my 2 gold chains and 2 gold rings about 45 grams and my mobiles as evidence and they left.

After they left we came to know that we have been duped and we called the Sanjaynagar police and lodged a complaint. (Complaint No: 0025/2015)

Sanjaynagar Police are the most professional police I have seen. They told me not to worry and promised to find the culprits. They met me regularly and gave me hope and gave me peace of mind.

Recently Sanjaynagar Police have apprehended  all the 3 person's who robbed me and recovered all my stolen item's. 
 
I would like to Congratulate the entire Sanjaynagar Police and their staff for a swift response and moreover the Professional Attitude with which they behaved with me.

I would like to thank the Sanjaynagar Crime Police :

(1) Inspector Parameshwar Hegde
(2) PSI Narasimhayya 
(3) ASI Srinivas
(4) Naresh
(5) Mahesh 
(6) Nagraj 
(7) Natesh 
(8) Sanjeev 

Dear Sir,
                I kindly request you to personally call Sanjaynagar crime Police and congratulate them for solving this case and providing me much needed relief.

Thank You
Ravi shankar

 Phoenix Marketcity Bengaluru presents No Honking on canvas in association with Bangalore Traffic Police

The city Bengaluru with its explosion in terms of population and its purchasing power has seen an upsurge in the number of vehicles which is simply mind-boggling. Well what all these vehicles have added to the city apart from pollution is the alarming increase of decibel levels through unchecked noise pollution.

In todays world where everyone is time pressed and always in a hurry to get to ones destination, a major impairment that has crept in is the rising degree of impatience and adding to this misery is the menace of traffic. And what could result with the fatal combination of impatience and traffic  nothing but HONKING. Noise pollution is just as unhealthy as any other kind of pollution as it directly impairs the neurological health and contributes to several ailments including heart diseases and anxiety.

Phoenix Marketcity Bengaluru, has taken its best foot forward, in association with the Bengaluru Traffic Police to educate people through a visual demonstration on the adverse effects of HONKING by hosting an art exhibition on the theme of  No Honking.  This art exhibition showcases artistic expression of 19 renowned talents from Vadodara in the likes of Amarnath Sharma, Debasish Dutta, Jagannath Mohapatra, Jaldeep Chauhan, Jayant Parikh, Kashyap Parikh, Ketan Amin, Kruti Bhatt, Nandini Das, Nandu Rathawa, Nimisha Rao, Poorva Nimkar, Prantik Chattopadhyay, Rahul Mukherjee, Ritesh Rajput, Sandeep Joshi, Sanjay Rajwar, Santa Rakshit, Shiv Verma. Most of the artists who have contributed to this noble cause belong to The Faculty of Fine Arts, M S University, Vadodara (Gujarat).  Mr. Sachin Kaluskar an art curator from Vadodara has played a crucial role in facilitating the exhibition.

The art exhibition aims to educate the civic society about the uncivil practices of Honking in the city. It is indeed necessary to talk to the public on how to keep a tab and control over honking and eventually make Bengaluru a noise free city.

The No Honking Art exhibition was inaugurated on 31st Mar by Additional Commissioner of Police- (Traffic), Dayananda, IPS and is open to general public from 31st March to 12th April, from 11:00 am to 9 pm. The paintings exhibited not only entertain the onlookers with their beauty and aesthetics but sublimely communicate the consequences of unwarranted Honking.  The paintings are sure to make the onlookers ponder on the effects of Honking.
Be part of this social initiative by visiting the No Honking Art Exhibition at Phoenix Marketcity Bengaluru and show your support.

Today i.e. on 31st March 2015 I received a call from phone no +919212131356 in which the person claimed to be calling from some credit card company in New Delhi. The moment I told him that I am not interested and he should not have called me since I am on DND he started abusing me in the chicest of profanities. This went on for 10 minutes before he hung up. I request the Bangalore Police to take appropriate steps to bring this person to book. My phone number is 7829907366

Hello sir, I got a call 9350569074 this morning on the name of CIBIL, offering several benefits & in turn seeking my credit card related information. When enquired about caller's identity, he disconnected the call and immediately switched off. Kindly look into this matter. 
Is Karnataka part of India or is different country. I was under the belief what media says about Bangalore Discrimination was just a hype and never believed that. The 20 year strong belief just got broken today morning. One bike chap (think this is the number -KA 03 MP 4939 Honda bike) was behind me and was honking continuously when he with his eye can see the signal is red, then overtook me from left side. When I asked him why cant he be patience when he knows the signal is red? His answer I am following rule. The traffic rule says I can overtake from left. When I told him he is wrong his next statement left me in shock. Speak in kanada as this is my country and my land. I sincerely thought am I in India or Unites States of Karnataka. But realized the saying by Birbal (at time of Mugal rule) really fits him well that I was searching for one idiot and got to meet 1000 idiot and he was one of them. So now I believe that there is Discrimination in Bangalore. Trust once broken cannot be revived, once its gone its can be only remembered not gained again.

Yesterday late midnight ( 2.30 am exactly) , while  returning to Malleshwaram,Bangalore  on Nelamangala BNG NH, I took glimpse of more than 6-7 ATMs of different commercial banks. In all these ATMs the security guard was fast asleep, some of them covering their head with muffler or blanket, one or two in totally uncomfortable position in the given plastic chair but in deep ( coma type) sleep. My intention of this post is not  to blame these poor security guards but to start a serious discussion between Banks & Police dept. regarding the real necessity of all such ATMs to be kept open 24/7 . Statistical data need to be seriously obtained regarding real usage of ATMs  during unearthly hours ( 12 midnight to 5 am). This will definitely guide the Protection  and Banking authorities to decide upon SAFE OPEN TIME of all ATMs leading to safety of all concerned. 
While we all appreciate the work done by BTP, I would like to know if anything is being done to catch hold of private buses with those horribly sounding extremely loud air horns. Specially in and around the Sumnalli-Goraguntepalya-Yeshwantpur stretch.
Please do something about this before we lose our hearing abilities my dear Policemen!

WHAT HAS THE CITY POLICE DONE TO ENSURE MY SAFETY IN THIS CITY?
I'm an engineering student studying at AMC Engineering College, Bannergetta, residing at HSR Layout...I travel up and down everyday by BMTC. This is the third incident in my life where I was Nearly STABBED by thugs at the silk-board BTM junction in broad daylight (if you require the exact time 7:20 AM) I was stolen of my wallet and once even my backpack, was hurt on my arm too!  ISN'T THIS SUFFICIENT PROOF FOR THE CITY POLICE of a developed city like BANGALORE??? 
If you ask me "Why a FIR hasn't been registered?  " I was told that I have not provided sufficient evidence even after describing the incident in detail, will the police in an educated city like bangalore listen to citizens who speak only in KANNADA (yes I've joined a kannada learning centre) if at all they don't speak ENGLISH don't they atlest understand the language?? Aren't they taught the basic ethics that they should speak polite to the people? (yes, I understand their difficulties and hardship)
Why is it that they refused to register an FIR? Why was I let down by the city police, more than once? Why is it that the police reply saying that don't use this route for daily commute? ( which I believe is one of the most crowded route of all) CAN I ONCE FEEL SECURE WHILE I COMMUTE? OR IS IT THAT YOU EXPECT ME TO NOT CARRY A MOBILE, A WALLET,  A BACKPACK OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL?? 
please do reply," I AS A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY DEMAND AN ANSWER FROM THE POLICE "

One person arrested in Upparpet, 11 motorbikes worth Rs 8.25lakhs recovered, 4 reported cases of BloreCity detected. 
In a unique record, the Upparpet traffic police station cop sitting at the reception always tells people who visit to pay the traffic fines everytime that the traffic violation is not reflecting online for the offence they claimed even after one week. So slow the cops work, one may think. But the truth is otherwise. It is a gimmick played on the motorists to fleece them. This is a routine since last three months as my experience and others go. Please instruct them to take the fine whoever appears and not to trouble people asking them to come again next day. 
 
The bus stop at BYATARAYANAPURA on Bellary Road  near Shabari Bakery Is becoming a hindrance to the smooth flow of traffic as It Is at the junction to the connecting road to Shabari Nagar. At any gIven time at least 3-4 BMTC buses and at least one private bus crowd this narrow service road.It Is very dIfficult to enter or exit the main Bellary Road as vehicles criss cross from both sides.You are requested to give permission to BMTC to shift the bus stop to a more convenient location.Your favourable reply is solicited.

Actual reason for your complaint is BWSSB work is in progress along the ring road starting from Agara JN to Bellandur JN, thats why since 1 month traffic movement is slow. Today at 12 pm, Myself and Acp called BWSSB and BDA officers to the working place and insisted to complete it early and do asphalting work.
ORRCA is putting skywalker infront of eco space, they will start in a month. we will try our best for free flow of traffic. thank you.

Reply Details: Sir, noted your suggestion, actually BWSSB work is in progress, and we have insisted to finish the work as early as possible. and also we have written letters to BWSSB. they have assured that they will complete in 3 weeks.then it will be alright.

Dear Madam,
This is to draw your kind attention to my complaint registered on 19/3/2015 with FIR No. IPC 1860 (U/s-380) under Madiwala Police Station for the theft happened at my Room (PG) at around 8:30 AM-8:45 AM. Somebody had stolen my Laptop, Mobile Phone, a bag consisting of Hard Disk etc. I am constrained to bring your attention of this growing menace of thieves/robbers either some one living in the same building or some one from outside. Similar incident happened in my room around 9 months back at the same time where my roommate lost his Mobile Phone & tablet.

Imp Note : 1. There has been no police visits yet at the crime place after the complaint.
2. Lost valuables are actually worth more than Rs 1 Lakh.
3. No sight of policeman's in and around this scene will be more advantageous for the culprit to indulge in similar thefts and robberies more confidently in future.

I am hereby requesting your department to do a thorough investigation of this unfortunate occurrence. I am confident that you will not leave any stones unturned to make the perpetrators answer for what they have done. Should you have any inquiries or clarifications or if you need additional information about the case, you may reach me at the following contact information.

Hello Sir, It is regularly noticed that vehicles (especially autos and taxis) use the Benniganahalli under-pass to reach NGEF and Kasturinagar. This under-pass is a ONEWAY but still vehicles move on the wrong side. No Entry board is placed on a corner which is not visible to most people. Also there is no Policing around that underpass. Please help to do something about this problem. 

Thanks,

Sir,
Vehicles coming from KR Puram toward Marathally over Mahadevapura flyover are coming very very fast as that slope of flyover. Some cabs and goods vehicles are very rash.. I feel its better to keep speed breaker just after flyover like in sarjapura junction ring road and other place. Before flyover in mahadevapura, there is one speed breaker for vehicles going below/on flyover toward KR Puram. Same way please install one for vehicles coming down of flyover from KR Puram.

I think you know that last Monday one accident happened and yesterday night one more accident happen in ring road after flyover near to Indian Oil petrol bunk. Its because of vehicles riding very rash. Those drivers are not bother about people. 

This road became very dangerous, please take action and install speed breakers or some other kind of preventive measures.

Thanks

Respected Sir,
I am resident of Mahadevapura Outer ring road, opp. Indian oil petrol bunk. The service road connects Doddanakundi to Mahadevapura flyover down is made very nice and no speed breakers so vehicles are going very fast in service road. I stay in Garuda Star Field, I feel very dangerous when ever I want to come out of my apartment into service road as vehicles moving very fast in service road. 

Today morning just about to happen accident near Nester Raga apartment entrance road in service road by rash Tempo Traveler cab driver at 7:40AM. These cab drivers and Autos are very rash. Please take action and install speed breakers, at Garuda Star Field, Chinnappa layout, and Nester Raga entrance road.

Sir , please see the footpath of Vignan Ragar to BEML gate road on both sides , either encroached by shopkeepers or full dirty with human faeces and garbage or illegally parked vehicles . Its such a long road and its difficult to walk on either side .

Bengaluru is celebrating Rama navami like never before, and forcing everyone to celebrate it by putting loud speakers in every street with full bass playing devotional songs from morning. 
My devotion towards Rama is reducing after every song. I pity for the school kids who have exams in near future.
I assume the people who have put these speakers have taken the permission from the respective Police stations. Bengaluru Traffic Police people are watching your actions towards this. 
BCP, 

This is regarding smoking at public places. 
Today, I was visiting Shanti Sagar Self-service hotel which is behind Jayanagar 4th Block Post Office. 

There is a Paan shop outside the restaurant and there were a lot of people smoking inspite of it being a public place. 

I alighted the hotel cashier but it was of no use. Seems that those people are well known to the cashier as they were speaking casually. 

This place is just a stone throw away from Jayanagar Police Station. 

Can something be done about it.

What is the spot fine for drunken driving?
There is no spot fine for drunken driving. In each of the drunken driving case, police notice is issued asking the person to appear before the court. Only court is empowered to impose the fine.
What happens if I dont appear in the court?
If you fail to appear in court, warrant will be issued from the court. This may lead to arrest and stiffer penalty.
What is the punishment for drunken driving?
In the first instance there can be penalty up to Rs.3000/- which may extend to imprisonment in subsequent offence.
After being booked for drunken driving can I continue to drive myself?
No. you will have to arrange for an alternate driver who is not drunk or take a cab leaving the vehicle in the police station which will be released after you have settled the case in the court.
When can a motorist be charged with drunk driving? What is the procedure for paying the fine?
A motorist caught driving with alcohal content over 40 mg per 100 ml of  blood is liable to be charged with drunk driving. This is checked with the help of an alcometer. Even though legally permissible limit is 30 mg we do not charge people upto 40mg. Our instruments are caliberated every three months with +(-) 5% accuracy. That explains the relaxation upto 40 mg. There are no spot fines for drunk driving. No police officer is expected to collect spot fines for this offence. The person will be given a notice along with a copy of the alcometer readings. The other copy, along with a copy of the notice, will be sent to the court and the offender will have to pay a fine there. The punishment for drunk driving is six months' imprisonment or payment of a fine up to Rs 2,000, or both. If the offender is caught committing the offence a second time, he will have to face imprisonment of two years or a fine up to Rs3,000, or both. After being issued a notice, the motorist will not be allowed to drive. He will have to leave his vehicle behind and take a cab home, or call a friend or relative to drive him home. Very often, motorists try to avoid legal proceedings by bribing the police officers concerned. However, the best thing to do in such circumstances is to follow the proper procedures and not resort to collusive corruption. Moreover, if a person continues to drive under the influence of alcohol and gets involved in a fatal accident, he will be booked for culpable homicide - which is a non-bailable offence.

Post details : 
Pls visit hoskerhalli-ring road junction near PEA college... Two wheelers, autos and now even tractors have made it their birth right to come in the wrong side. Vehicles coming from hoskerehalli side take a left turn on the wrong side and go head on to the upcoming vehicles( coming from kamyakya side and moving towards Mysore road). This happens daily and more so during morning hours when school vehicles are plying. There is no cop or anyone to take action..

Reply : To solve this problem, we have given requisition to TTIC. Even we have booked lot of cases in this place. The wrong side riders/dricers are all local people of this area. Hence we are waiting for the suggestion from TTIC to sort out this problem as early as fast.
Be a good neighbor by serving as an extra set of eyes & ears for the POLICE.

Dear Sir, 
Now a day's the Ring road from Nayandhalli to Goruguntepalya is filled with roadside truck venders. Earlier there used to be one or two venders  occupy the road. Now they can be find in the radius of 20 mts. If one vehicle stops for buying the traffic disturbance starts. It is like any bazar on evening times. I don't know why traffic police has allowed to run the business on roads. Kindly take action against this. They can park there vehicles in a safe place and attract customers & do business. But they park in the sides of main road it will create a traffic jam. Please do take action on this.

Good Morning Friends, Happy Weekend to all. Follow Traffic Rules 24 X 7.
Day Quote: "The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence."
http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/crime/Cops-to-set-up-a-laboratory-to-help-catch-phone-thieves/articleshow/46718810.cms? Responding to the rising cases of phone robberies and thefts, the city police are moving to set up a laboratory for tracking lost phones with the help of the IMEI numbers.
Team BTP would like to know if there was enough research or analysis done at Marathahalli junction, before making this new U turn after the bridge.
This is creating a lot of traffic jams than it was earlier.
Either let's have the old option where vehicles can take the Right turn from both HAL towards Kundanahalli open on the bridge to go towards Sarjapur, Intel, n vehicles coming from Kundanahalli towards HAL take right turn n go towards KRPuram DoddaNekkundi et all.

Recently the divider was cut open under the skywalk n vehicles are forced to use that as a U turn, all the office buses from those Marcopolo mini buses to the big BMTC buses going to Infosys are finding it difficult, as there are some buses stopping in front of ShantiSagar hotel for breakfast or lunch n the vehicles which try to use the Uturn are compulsioned to take a reverse gear n take the full uturn, this is causing a lot more traffic jam than it was earlier.

Also there are chances of accidents at this spot like the recent Hebbal case. As vehicles coming down the flyover towards Marathahalli junction are at much higher speed than that of normal road.

Hence suggest you to have a relook at this n have the proper u turn out there which was there earlier till 2014 before the median was constructed on the signal on the main Marathahalli junction.

The other thing which is noticed was the road from the junction towards HAL has been dug up damn in the mid of the road and not yet relaid till date. Vehicles coming from HAL have been facing a lot of inconvenience at the market bus stop as everyone wants to drive only on the available road than getting stuck in the dugged up road. Kindly ask the local MLA, corporator, BBMP,BDA BWSSB, and the rest of their tribe to relay this road on a weekend or during the upcoming next long weekend, when traffic is expected to be less.

Why not a out of box thought of having the metro construction or plan be proposed from Kundanahalli junction to Corporation circle as its almost a straight road except for a few turns at Varthur lake n Commando Hospital road up to Agaram signal a slight turns, rest all of the road is a straight road. I suppose this is feasible enough if all the decision makers have their hearts on development plank for the city n reduce the traffic on the roads giving our cop's the much needed break. Also this entire metro stretch shld be given to some 5-6or even more companies in the infrastructure side to complete the work in npo more than 4years time without any delay else they will have to pay fines. No political involvement is encouraged once the work starts on this. This way all the comments on making Bangalore like Singapore will be realized.
Similarly a metro on the entire ORR will help. While the construction is going on all the vehicle users are requested to use public transport only to avoid traffic jams.

Trust there is some message in my post that can be considered if not ignored fully. 
Hi team,
You guys are doing a great job. 
Can you assign some cops near HP building near Madavara? We see so many 2 wheelers coming in the opposite way towards K.R.Puram in the evening time. This is making a lot of problems for the On-goers, when going towards Hoodi Circle.
Thanks in Advance,

Action required *** I posted an ad for a flatmate in the 2 bhk (where I live in Mosque road,Frazer town )couple of months back and immediately got responses and the first girl who came down got the place... She was working with indigo airlines at that time which convinced me that she can afford the high rent..hence allowed her 2months time to pay the deposit..but I was wrong and trusted her innocent face which lead me being robbed by her with cash and jewellery and more shockingly she managed to vanish overnight and left the job too.. FIR has been lodged with her passport details but thanks to our police who disagreed to work on it without some motivation(monetary of course).....
Can any of you lead me to a solution as I am not sure if she gonna repeat the same...got to know she did similar thing in Hyderabad too.

Post date:26.03.2015
Post details : Hi Sir, I am a resident of Bangalore, and I travel everyday to reach my office via SilkBoard, over the flyover from Bommanahalli towards Madiwala. It is noted for last few weeks, the vehicles coming from Bommanahalli towards silkboard signal (below flyover) block the entire road (Probably because the signal and towards BTM, Maratahalli is jammed). Because of this, the vehicles coming from service road or bommanahalli going towards Madiwala are blocked, though the entire flyover is empty. Please have some facility to avoid this deadlock.

Reply From Madivala Inspector : Madam, we have put big board to educate the road users, also we are booking maximum cases . however we will enforce it strictly.

Post details: Bengaluru Traffic Police Travel from Agara to Iblur junction is getting worse day by day...There is a big pile up all the way from Indian oil petrol bunk at hsr till iblur junction... Heavy trucks are parked in service road forcing cars and two wheelers to use main road... Adding to it is the bwssb digging work...They just left the road after digging in parts... Is this getting noticed ?? Are we going to live with this pain everyday? Can the concerned officials do something about this ?

Reply From Madivala Inspector: Sir, BWSSB work is in progress, so there is a slow movement, we have written a strong letter to BWSSB engineers, and also we have requested  BDA engineers to do asphalting work. they have assured that it will be completed in 15 months.

1. The Electric Poles came on Jun 17,2014 (few days before election). We are inching close to Jun 17,2015 and yet not a single light has come up for the stretch from Forum Koramangala till MG Road. Should we wait until PM Mr.Modi plans to take a trip on this route to see the lights come up?

2. Almost everyone coming from Adugodi takes a 'U' turn at this junction towards Forum, though a No U turn board stares at them. I have never seen any Cop around here, nor anyone bothered to obey traffic laws in Bangalore.

3. Traffic police at Madiwala signal 'sleeps' through the evening when Motorists are bluntly violating every freaking traffic law I know of.
If we call them to regulate traffic, they refuse to move from their place and ignore us totally. 

4. The road under Hebbal Flyover is a strict one-way. Both Traffic and Crime branch police can be seen manning check-posts here. But I have never (NEVER) seen any of them bothered to stop the idiots driving on the wrong side with Hi-Beam lights directly cutting into traffic going towards KIA.

These are just few..Driving in Bangalore is the worst nightmare I've been having for the past 5yrs. 
is this right ahh sir.....? 
Hi BTP, the puncture mafia has again started their atrocity in outer ring road esp. from Iblur junction till HSR BDA flyover. It's so disappointing why we can't stop this on a permanent basis. I remember the culprit was tracked and caught by BTP or BCP few months back but now it's again started. Since public is annoyed this should be also treated as crime and the accused should be severely punished which would be a lesson for all. Seems all actions taken by police are valid only for a time frame and it has to be renewed, hoping a permanent solution for this. Thanks in advance.

P.S. I have reported this to BTP already and I was told to report to BCP also.

I'm not sure if this is the correct page to report this, however, couldn't find anyother place to do so. I stay in TC Palya Main Road near Anandpura Circle and I work in Whitefield. This has been happening for quite some time now, every night when I come back from work at 11 in the night I find stuff thrown inside my gate some times beer cans, big stones, today garbage etc.. and every day someone keeps throwing water on my dogs. This only happens on weekdays (Monday to Friday) never on weekends (Saturday and Sunday or if I'm on leave). Please advise what should I do. 
Again I apologise if this is the wrong place to raise this issue.

This is to bring to your kind attention about the gross violation of the traffic light at Kalyan Nagar ORR signal, the present of a traffic policeman hardly bothers the regular rule breakers that they just speed away and this is co very common at this junction that the presence of a traffic light is now become a joke.

Hello Bengaluru residents,

Beware all the debit/credit card users! Looks like there is some serious cyber crime happening in and around Bengaluru!
 This incident happened with one of my dear friend, where, she started getting HDFC money withdrawal alerts, one after another in her cell phone at the middle of the night, saying that transactions are taking place somewhere near Richmond Road, while she was seated in her room about to go to sleep. We sat dumbstruck as we realise that the debit card is not stolen, is intact in her wallet and very much safe with us, though the ATM transactions are happening somewhere. We had no clue what was happening. We immediately tried contacting HDFC customer care number, while the money withdrawal alerts kept coming. Panic-stricken and unable to reach the customer care, we felt very helpless. After 10 minutes, my friend got a call in her cell phone from an HDFC personnel. He enquired if it was her doing all the transactions. On confirming that it(of course) isn't her, they confirmed that it is a fraud withdrawal case and guided us on how to lock the online banking and ATM card. 
Alas, by that time all the money, a sum of Rs. 1,21000/- were gone from her account. The thieves did not leave a single penny. 

We were instructed by the HDFC officials to file an FIR and then raise a dispute case in HDFC bank. We did as instructed. Thanks to the Ashoka Nagar Police station because of whom the process seemed little smooth, if not completely. Now, we have raised the issue to the HDFC dispute team and are yet to know if we are getting the money back. Although they have assured that investigation will happen.

It seems there is some kind of chip which the cyber criminals can insert into the ATM machines and swiping machines with the help of which they will be able to obtain all the information of your card. Then they begin making clones of your cards, swipe in some secluded ATM spots and steal your money while you can only sit and see the amount in your account becoming NIL. 

The P.S.I of Ashoka Nagar shared some useful information with us which I would like to mention here:

1. Please refrain from using your debit/credit cards in any ATM and swiping machines in shops without validating.
2. Be sure of the ATMs and swiping machines where you choose to swipe your cards.
3. Always prefer to use the ATMs which are attached to the banks as these ATMs are regularly audited.
4. If possible, try and avoid mobile banking.
5. Do not keep such lump sum amount in the account for which you are using the debit card.
6. Try keeping the money in an account for which you do not use the debit card as much.

I guess you all know these points already but might miss out on following it on a daily basis. We got a shock of our lives and are still in, so do not want anybody to go through the same situation ever. With a little care and caution, we can avoid such incidents. Precaution is always better.

Dear Friends, Please Don't  SMOKE. 
Sir,
I had registered a case in Cubbon Park Police Station aganist accidental death of my brother-in-law who was working in BESCOM on feb 2012. Later I couldn't proced the case due to personal problems. Case was registered under 194c. Police officers are not giving me the 'B Report - final verdict from Magistrate' which is issued by Taslidhar from taluk office. If I ask police officer regarding this he is telling that its not his duty to give the above report and also he is using foul language and threating me. If police only does so whom should we contact for help.
I need that report to claim LIC policy amount.
Kindly help me.

Today at 4:01 pm, I got a call from +919547026386. The person on the other end said that he is the branch manager of my bank and said that my ATM card is blocked.
In order to release the same he asked me to key in my card no and the expiry date,which I didn't do as I was aware of this racket. All these days I'd read about this in newspapers. But today got an experience of the same.
I would request the cyber cell to look into this matter to prevent innocent people from falling into this fraudulent trap.

Hi, Just wanted to let you all know about the smoking issue near Dell (IRR domlur) building. I see many people from Dell and other companies located nearby standing and smoking on footpath located near Exit gate of Dell... I guess smoking is banned in public places, so why are they smoking on footpath..? and they make the place dirty with cigarettes buds and empty tea cups..... Please take action on this, I understand Dell already has smoking zone inside the campus.... so its not fairy to smoke in public areas.... thanks!

Sir when benglor city police constable result?? 
Hello Sir, kindly check the operators of the number 8096002870. I got a call from this number saying they are calling from "Planet..." something and that my number has won 5gms of gold. they will send this gold via post and that i have to pay handling charges of Rs. 525 to the postman. I tried to get as much information as possible but the person was trying to get address to send the parcel. when i refused, he said again that i was losing 5gm of gold. This is in my opinion as really good strategy to make money. The background noise indicated it was like a call center. 
Cigarettes are sold in all shops that are very near to entrance of Bangalore City College, 160, Chelekere Main Road, Banaswadi Outer Ring Road, Kalyanagar Post, Behind BTS Bus Depot.

> Vehicles coming from Rajaijnagar, Vijaynagar, Malleshwaram side may use Malleshwaram link road and via Sheshadripuram may reach Basaveshwara circle, KR circle & further.
> Vehicles coming from Magadi road side by taking right turn at Hunasemara Jn may move towards Binnymill, Sirsi circle, City market, Townhall & further.
> Vehicles coming from Rajbhavan road side by taking left turn at Basaveshwara circle may reach KR circle, KG road, Majestic area & further.
Today while I was returning from office at 1.00 AM, on lake road BTM layout(2nd stage) 2 police constables stopped me and ask for DL and other documents of my bike. As i always carry DL with me, I produce it for their verification however they started demanding for RC as well. I told them per law I do not need to always carry RC, I can produce it before them in morning. They told I have to go to MICO Layout Police station.
I agreed, as I did not want to pay them any money which they were indirectly asking for.

One of the guard accompanied me in my bike to MICO Layout police station. In the Police station I was told, I have to produce documents then only they will allow me to take my bike. One police man asked for my bike key and kept it. I asked them whether I will get any chalan/receipt for the proof that my bike is seized with them to which the policeman answered that he has over 300 vehicles seized and he is not giving any document to anyone. 

Finally at midnight  01:30 AM, I was made to walk 3 kilometer to reach home just because I was not carrying RC with me which is not illegal.

I want to ask Bangalore City Police how can they be so insensitive ? 
What action you are going to take ? 
Any suggestions for me as in the morning I am visiting the MICO layout Police station again to produce the documents and get my bike back.

Please assist.

Dear Sir,

In Bidadi, Auto Drivers were demanding for too much fares for nearer distances who were moving to Industrial Area at Bidadi. if the passengers wont give high fares they were attacking on them with other auto drivers support.

Nearly some 1000's of people will be visiting these Industial Areas and Industries daily, they dont have proper bus communication to these places to reach in time. so they were to depend on these auto's. 

by seeing all sides oppurtunities auto drivers were behaving like anything. plz take the sever action on these issue plz. 
Our case number is 111/2014 and it haven't been solved from past 8 months. Our case is registered at Chickpet police station and we are helpless. So I request you to please look into our case and come to a better conclusion.

Arrested 1 offender Tabrez & recovered 4 LCD TV,3 laptop, microwovens & other expensive electronic items which he had stolen. 
8th Main Road, Malleswaram from 19th Cross to Yeshwanthpur Circle was a nice wide road. Suddenly an "Auto Lane" has been created. Hardly any autos ply on this road & many don't use the lane as it is "Optional". Added to this, on this stretch several private buses are parked through the day. I don't know who has given them permission. This streach is also used by the RTO for testing. Further when there is some function in the kalyana Mantapa, the road gets even more clogged. The Auto Lane is of no use & it is suggested that this be removed. Also buses should not be allowed to be parked 24 hours of the day.

At 9:45 a Renault Pulse yellow board cab and stopped in front me and asked where? I said towards Kundanahalli Gate. They said get in, by that time there were 4 people inside the cab. One of the guy in left side got down and letting me to sit in the middle of back seat and telling me that he will get down at Innovative Multiplex. After boarding into the cab, they took a "U" turn at innovative multiplex. As soon as they took a different way I told them to stop the car, they were saying that will go from another way. 

I was forcing the driver to stop and pulling his shoulder to stop the car he didn't he said in Kannada to close the windows with black sunshades. People beside me started closing windows with sunshades, I tried to escape from the car and shouting help me. They closed my mouth and holded my neck tightly , so that i cannot shout. I was pushing those sunshades at the back window and asking for help at the cars behind. But no use, I lost hope at that time they broke my left leg and keep on hitting on my face. 

I was keeping on pleasing them not to Kill Me. They took my wallet and asked for the ATM pins and withdrawn my money from ATMs and they thrown me in the outskirts of Sarjpur Road near Hallanahalli Lake. From there with my injured leg walked at least half km for help. Some people came and called my friends and helped me.

1. What blackmailing CD was making D.K.RAVI worrying for 3 to 4 days that he did not tell the contents of the CD to anyone. 2. Why did D.K.RAVI come to his house at 11.30am to meet someone at home and not in his office. 3. Who were the 3 men who entered the St. Johns Wood Apartments @ 12.30 pm. 4. Why did the 3 men not come in a car. 5. Why did the 3 men in a formal wear with a tie with 3 briefcases did not enter their name and mobile no with the security guard. 6. As soon as the door was opened by D.K.RAVI wife, why was everyone allowed inside so quickly and steal the evidences. 7. Why was D.K.RAVI shirt tucked in so neatly with his sleaves buttoned while he was hanging as there was no form of struggle seen in his dress 8. Why did the police said that there was a death note in the beginning and later said that there was no death note. 9. Why was the ceiling fan not bent or damaged. 10. Why was the noose around his neck tied to D.K.RAVI left side and not the right side. 11. Why is the file missing in which D.K.RAVI had prepared a complete detailed report against Embassy Golf Links where the Embassy Group had encroached 39,633 sq feet of defence land in domlur where he was about to raid the Embassy Group the very next day. 12. Why did K.J.George and Rama Linga Reddy came rushing to see D.K.RAVI dead. 13.

Why is D.K.RAVI 2 cell phones, 1 laptop and 1 I pad still not given to the cyber crime department for scrutiny. 19. Why the government does not want a CBI probe into the incident. 20. Why is the post mortem report still not come even after 4 days. 21. Why are the CCTV footage of the apartment not scrutinised. Why why why why

Sir,
I had registered a case in Cubbon Park Police Station aganist accidental death of my brother-in-law who was working in BESCOM on feb 2012. Later I couldn't proced the case due to personal problems. Case was registered under 194c. Police officers are not giving me the 'B Report - final verdict from Magistrate' which is issued by Taslidhar from taluk office. If I ask police officer regarding this he is telling that its not his duty to give the above report and also he is using foul language and threating me. If police only does so whom should we contact for help.
I need that report to claim LIC policy amount.
Kindly help me 
Dear All,
My name is Shamanth. My concern here by is that 
The my colleagues came to take the phone which i had with me.
This person who was riding KA 01 MG 7785, white bolero suddenly comes to the street and starts abusing " . I told him they are my colleagues. They just come to take phone. He again starts abusing. Is this what we expect out of police.? i appreciate he is doing his job. But is his job not to analyse or explore what happened.? Is it just to come and hit anyone who is even standing in the street. 
Building construction work till 11:30 PM. #WhitefieldPolice didn't come despite 5 calls. #DNAApartments at #Nallurahalli. Residents were there for 1.5 hours but they didn't stop the work. 
I just have one request. When are the police guys gonna stop taking bribe from citizens? I can see if a common man goes to police station for his passport verification then need to pay a bribe of 200-500rs. 
The police will let us go on any traffic violation just for 10rs - 200rs.
The complete govt sectors is filled with bribe. I just have one question. Aren't you guys ashamed of taking a bribe? I know i cant change the entire nation, however i can report few things which i can see. The JP Nagar Police station which is located near Rangashankara are completely pathetic. When you write a complaint on a white paper they say don't waste the paper your government wont give it for free. Everyday the passport verification guy takes a bribe. I guess he makes around 5-10k by just taking bribe. They do give a miss call while coming for the passport verification and they want us to call back, and when they come home for verification they take 100-200 rs minimum. 

I know whatever i write is going to be waste and it will not make any impact, still i hope there is someone who wants to change the city. 
Today, I went to a wine shop which is 200 mtrs away from my house in murugeshpalya to buy some liquor. When i was returning, I was asked to stop by a policeman. He checked my vehicle documents which was alright. Then he asked me whether I'm drunk or not. Since I wasn't drunk, I told him NO. After which he wrote down my details, my mother tongue , name & phone number. I was asking him, why do I have to give my personal details just like that, he didn't reply to it consciously. I'm wondering, is this the regular practice to note down these details ? I can understand if I was under suspicious circumstances, where as this happened at 10 pm. I'm surprised what was the reason he noted down my personal details ???

Dear BCP - 
Every day I see lot of speed interceptor detector in Marthahalli, Hebbal, Hosur and many interior roads which is very very unscientific. We die to cross 200 mtrs traffic during peak hours, but traffic police with these interceptor stop us when the seep is 70/80 which is very unethical. A traffic before and after these speed check interceptor will be sick, but the police wait for only bribe (Sorry to use this known word), please stop this atlest inside city. We(Public) die everyday with traffic, do not catch the vehicles whose speed is atlest 100 KM/Hour for only 200/300 meters that too in the tapering roads. We (Employees in Electronic city wanted to conduct a strike on this and bring into M.N Reddy's notice. Please help. Thanks. Satish..!!!

Dear Sir,

It has really become a pain for the pedestrians to walk on the stretch from Sarakki signal towards Kanakpura road ( Near Purva belmount apartment). Almost most of the 2 wheelers drive on the pavements leaving very less/no space for the pedestrians to walk on pavements. They also honk at us (Even if though its their mistake) while they are riding on the pedestrians pavements. 

This really causing lot of problems to Pedestrians like us. We are forced to walk on the "Left over" over the road. It is like walking into death trap. This has become a daily menace.

 Please see the attached photo for proof. The lady ( circled in photo) can be seen struggling to walk on road as the 2 wheelers are every where ( on pavements as well). I could not take more pictures as I had to board my company bus.

Please help us and take strict action against such defaulters.

This poem made me cry
Please make ur kids read it too.
I went to a party Mom,
I remembered what you said.
You told me not to drink Mom,
So I drank soda instead.
I really felt proud inside Mom,
The way you said I would.
I didn't drink and drive Mom,
Even though the others said I should.
I know I did the right thing Mom,
I know you are always right.
Now the party is finally ending Mom,
As everyone is driving out of sight.
As I got into my car, Mom,
I knew I'd get home in one piece.
Because of the way you raised me,
So responsible and sweet.
I started to drive away Mom,
But as I pulled out into the road,
The other car didn't see me Mom,
And hit me like a load.
As I lay there on the pavement Mom,
I hear the policeman say, "the other guy is drunk," Mom,
And now I'm the one who will pay.
I'm lying here dying, Mom.
I wish you'd get here soon.
How could this happen to me Mom?
My life just burst like a balloon.
There is blood all around me Mom,
And most of it is mine.
I hear the medic say, Mom,
I'll die in a short time.
I just wanted to tell you Mom,
I swear I didn't drink.
It was the others, Mom.
The others didn't think.
He was probably at the same party as I.
The only difference is, he drank and I will die.
Why do people drink, Mom?
It can ruin your whole life.
I'm feeling sharp pains now.
Pains just like a knife.
The guy who hit me is walking, Mom.
And I don't think it's fair.
I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare.
Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.
Tell Daddy to be brave.
And when I go to heaven, Mom,
Put "GOOD BOY " on my grave.
Someone should have told him, Mom,
Not to drink and drive.
If only they had told him, Mom,
I would still be alive.
My breath is getting shorter, Mom.
I'm becoming very scared.
Please don't cry for me, Mom.
When I needed you, you were always there.
I have one last question, Mom.
Before I say good bye.
I didn't drink and drive,
"So why am I the one to die?"
Someone took the effort to write this poem. So please, forward this to as many people as you can. So that it will make people understand not to mix drinking and driving.

Dear BTP. Almost all the buses of BMTC now have doors and often these are left open by the drivers. It is often seen that when buses stop at signals, people  get off (often encouraged to) instead of at bus stops.  This is a nasty and dangerous habit. Such people are obviously risking their own lives. Other drivers who would be taken by surprise would be blamed for any untoward incident. It is therefore, requested that BTP take up this important issue with BMTC and stop this menace.

 Congestion wreaks havoc on the environment, road infrastructure and your nerves. But a sensor-based solution may be in view.
Bangalore City Police in if an Inspector is not there, what is wrong is a Sergeant or a Constable files an FIR for the complainant? Your department need to take against those who failed to take police action, specially Constables and Sergeants and ASI and SI and any senior officer.  Nursing a broken leg, he tried to file a complaint against a phishing fraudster but cops deliver a shocker
Dear Sir

There are many unattended vehicles are parked below the wheelers bridge coxtown.Its causing lot of disturbances to residents and also people who coming for banks like sbt ,hdfc.Please do the need full. 
 Expect delay from KR circle towards Vidhansouda on Ambedkar road, due to a protest. Move inside Cubbonpark/ palace Rd to reach Shivajinagar
 #BTP  #Abandoned #Rajagopalnagar #Successstory

An abandoned vehicle by the roadside or unattended vehicle in a crowded place for a long time is definitely a cause of concern for the residents staying in the vicinity. One such incident of abandoned vehicle in Poornima school ground, Hegganahalli for last 20 days was brought to the notice of Police by Area Suraksha Mitra Vinod Kumar. 

Without any further delay the vehicle after thorough inspection was towed to the station immediately.

We thank Police Inspector Mahanand for the prompt action and initiative taken by our #AreaSurakshaMitra Vinod Kumar.

Thefts in sarjapur road area and sarjapur police station not taking proper action even after multiple complaints. Please look into this immediately and read about the thefts in hindu article( http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shoes-worth-rs-5-lakh-stolen/article7009571.ece ) The thefts took place in apartments near Sarjapur Road

Unprecedented number of trucks plying at night and early morning from Hosur and malur routed through alambadi then via chikkathirupathi moving towards gunjur road. Not sure what they are carrying but worth a look at it. 
Regarding DK Ravi's death : Father in law has gone on records that Ravi is not a person who would commit suicide....then by his own logic he should have not destroyed 'crime' scene and should have alerted local police or medical emergency? Who, why, how was dead body removed from fan/residence ?

Please conduct a fair investigation in the case of the death of the IAS officer. Do not bow down to political pressure since the officer is one among the IPS officers of this city who cleared the very same exam to become a bureaucrat. He is one of you.

Dear CPBLR

After having lost all faith on the system, I am trying this last attempt to make the law enforcers hear my plight...

On 9th April 2014, I was robbed of my backpack from my car by a gang of criminals who have been allegedly operating in Bangalore and follow a modus operandi of luring people's attention by throwing money and then robbing them. The attached video of the entire act was incidentally captured by a neighbouring cctv camera of the McDonalds outlet near Jyoti Nivas College in Koramangala. When I realised about the theft, I went to Koramangala Police Station and lodged an FIR with Serial No 0344/2014 and GSC# P01383140100350

To be honest with you, I never had any expectation that these criminals would be nabbed and my belongings would return to me, although the SI in charge that night assured me that very soon I shall be returned all my goods. But the the most hurting shock of my life came to me when I recently received a notice from the Police department that they were unable to trace the miscreants who did this after repeated attempts and hence the court has decided that I had made a false FIR and my report stands cancelled!

Sir, in an already lawless country like ours, we common citizens still look forward with some bit of hope towards the police force when we are faced with such adversities. But when the same police force slaps us back saying that we are at fault, we have nowhere else to go. I have lost my passport, my aadhaar card, highly important official documents and my brand new laptop in the theft....and after all this when we are labelled as liars by the law enforcers, it is a murder of our faith and belief. I am sharing the video to prove the genuineness of the incident and atleast expect acknowledgement of the incident and revocation of the false blame on me by the department

 Dear Road Users,
NORMAL SPEED MEETS, EVERY NEED. 
No one should pay for a mistake with their life. 
When we drive, we share the road with others, so the speed we choose to travel at needs to leave room for any potential error.
 #BTP  #Abandoned #Rajagopalnagar #Successstory

An abandoned vehicle by the roadside or unattended vehicle in a crowded place for a long time is definitely a cause of concern for the residents staying in the vicinity. One such incident of abandoned vehicle in Poornima school ground, Hegganahalli for last 20 days was brought to the notice of Police by Area Suraksha Mitra Vinod Kumar. 

Without any further delay the vehicle after thorough inspection was towed to the station immediately.

We thank Police Inspector Mahanand for the prompt action and initiative taken by our #AreaSurakshaMitra Vinod Kumar.

 Yesterday late night, one of my neighbor met with Accident. Auto driver was drunk and he is faulty for the accident. My neighbour was badly injured as he is fallen from bike. People around the place of accident, beat auto driver for his mistake, he ran away from that place. Then he stopped my neighbor while he is going home when is alone. He started demanding money for the accident. By the time I reached the place some other auto drivers came together an started threatening him. Immediately, I took photos of their auto numbers and took them to Police station for settlement. Auto drivers tried to speak in Kannada and tried to influence. But, Police realized the auto driver is faulty and he was drunk also, they immediately asked us to launch complaint. They themselves called traffic police to the spot (as this traffic issue) and they have taken riht action on Auto driver for stopping my neighbor when he is alone and threatening him. 

The way the police treated us, standing on the right side and not influenced with external thing, I really appreciate police from heart and Feel Bangalore one of the safest place to live. Thanks to Parappana Agrahara Police for giving us confidence. Appreciate from the heart.

Land Mafia and Bangalore police.
I am Canadian citizen got duped by Mr. Kesava K. of Maxworth Realty like 1000 others in bogus land deal scam on which he made 100s of crores . There are multiple FIRs and criminal cases on this man. Many of us spoke, wrote , tweeted to CP Mr. Reddi, DCP, Sandip Patil, Mr. Abhishek goyal, Mr. Ramesh, Mr. Alok, but they are just pushing from one person to another since last one year. Over 20 people have approached Commissinoer and DCP, but they are playing hide and seek game .Are they trying to protect Mr. Kesava ?? Are they waiting for another incidence like Mr.D.K. Ravi?  It seems Bangalore police is in no mood to respect law or book this man under fraud and IPC420 for whatever reasons best known to him.  This shows how land mafia work hand in glove with police and politicians. Latest case of D.k. Ravi would be eye opener, but in India it is routine affair , it will be forgotten in few days and mafia will continue to work with police and Bangalore. Shame on this silicon valley police  . #failingthehonest #actionbeginshere.  Thanks Arnab Goswami for exposing rigorously the scenario in Bangalore.

# M.N. Reddi Sir,
I had registered a case in Cubbon Park Police Station aganist accidental death of my brother-in-law who was working in BESCOM on feb 2012. Later I couldn't proced the case due to personal problems. Case was registered under 194c. Police officers are not giving me the 'B Report - final verdict from Magistrate' which is issued by Taslidhar from taluk office. If I ask police officer regarding this he is telling that its not his duty to give the above report and also he is using foul language and threating me. If police only does so whom should we contact for help.
I need that report to claim LIC policy amount.
Kindly help me.

Sir
Today I faced a strange incident and my full family escaped from an intentional accident by a influential local rowdy .I stay at  Sahakarnagar .We are returning to home after picking up my son from school and took a very safe turn near G Block and we saw one car is coming straight way and without stopping or slowing down it was almost hitting my car. Then we both stopped the car and that guy speaking Kannada and giving me slang and smelling of hard of drinks and as an 'outsider' I cann't speak kannada and asking him why he did that in hindi.I saw people standing around and checking us later two decent boy came in a scooty asked me to leave it.That guy was compeltely drunk and later that two boy told me he is a powerful member of Karnataka Rakshana Bedika(which I heard first time) and very influential and if he makes a call thousand local will be gathered. I couldn't take the number of the car as I was very scared.I'm writing this with shivering fingers .The color of the car is silver and that guy wearing a heavy gold chain. Only because of this scoundrel I could have lost my full family .We are feeling very depressed and helpless as I know if I go to local police station I may not get justice as  I don't have any evidence or witness on which police can take action. Please advise what I need to do.

This was taken near ayappa swamy temple mahalakshmipuram at 1950hrs.. 

the road was totally blocked due to illegal parking and what was shocking is ... it was your dept vehicle which was blocking the road... n the driver was on his seat on phone!!  Adding to it... he was not in uniform too...  may be it was a personal visit to temple in govt. Vehicle...?? this is really shocking and disturbing!!! 

Hope suitable action will be taken without any delay. Attached is the photo! !

I remember when there was a accident near esteem mall recently public was protesting for skywalker, but yesterday I saw near indiranagar 100 feet road , though there is a skywalker people were crossing the road, by disturbing vehicles, People must awake and only they can minimize accident, by using facilities what government has given. 
 
Dear Sir/Mam.. My mother has been receiving repeated calls for the following 2 phone numbers (+912261451530 & +912261451536).. They say that they are from some bank and I have to pay some outstanding credit card payments to them.. However on further probing, I understand that the passport details available with them are not mine which I politely conveyed to them.. I have also given them my number for them to call me instead of troubling my mother.. Despite doing all this, they still keep calling my mother and harassing her.. Kindly let me know on how I should address this issue.. Thanks in advance.. 
With Due respect, i have a suggestion to make. when i saw the the news today the way the Bangalore City Police was taken to task by the political parties, was not at all appreciable. with respect to the sad demise of #DKRAVI please probe all angles including his wife and  father-in-law. he being a politician can't rule out any compromise factor being put on him, and also need to ascertain if his wife had agreed to his parents living with them. call records and the duration of the call can tell us the truth. his death needs justice. either he was pushed to commit suicide or murder. show your mantle and prove those sick people who talk without thinking. please keep the media away in the whole process. 
Dear Team,

Lost my mobile and i blocked the SIM by service provider . Now want to block the mobile not to misuse by some one . How can i lodge and basic FIR online and block the mobile by police or manufactures with out visiting police station. 
I lost my mobile 4 months back .Has already complaint in HAL Police Station till now no response from police .

 A bus breakdown near Kaveri theatre jn on Bellary road has caused slow movement from Mekhri circle towards P.G.halli
Yesterday late night, one of my neighbor met with Accident. Auto driver was drunk and he is faulty for the accident. My neighbour was badly injured as he is fallen from bike. People around the place of accident, beat auto driver for his mistake, he ran away from that place. Then he stopped my neighbor while he is going home when is alone. He started demanding money for the accident. By the time I reached the place some other auto drivers came together an started threatening him. Immediately, I took photos of their auto numbers and took them to Police station for settlement. Auto drivers tried to speak in Kannada and tried to influence. But, Police realized the auto driver is faulty and he was drunk also, they immediately asked us to launch complaint. They themselves called traffic police to the spot (as this traffic issue) and they have taken riht action on Auto driver for stopping my neighbor when he is alone and threatening him. 

The way the police treated us, standing on the right side and not influenced with external thing, I really appreciate police from heart and Feel Bangalore one of the safest place to live. Thanks to Parappana Agrahara Police for giving us confidence. Appreciate from the heart. 
I dont understand why BMTC is operating Big buses in congested Begur Main road, i think it is to save diesel so that let the traffic happen who cares , if they send small sized buses the fuel will be distributed among 2-3 buses against one Bus.

One more thing i want to tell, the Traffic polices assigned for begur main road are always busy with talking in phone, i bet i can show the proof.

Please do something for these BTP

Good morning,  I remember recently public was protesting for skywalker near esteem mall , hebbal,  and yesterday I saw lot of people were crossing the road even though there is skywalker,  police also was there , I pity police whether they need to observe and maintain vehicle or public who walks on the centre of the road even though there is skywalker , but this police was doing both but we also should understand how much they also can do...

Hi, please change the name as "Bengaluru".
It's been such a long time our city name has been renamed. But people still write it as Bangalore. 
We must avoid unnecessary driving vehical near surround hospital area roads n use bypass road ,, by this hospitals roads will be trafic less n we can save patients and keep hospital environment as clean, pollution free and silence,, 
Hello sir,
            Its very nice to see you on the social networking site.. connecting to people and accept complaints from them as well as responding to them soon is very good. Really its a very nice idea. In Bangalore many people struggle with traffic problems but they don't have proper awareness to react towards those issues. Here in this page they get solutions to all their problems.

           In Bangalore there were so many reasons for the traffic jams. So to solve those problems I would like share some of my ideas with you. I don't think that all the problems will be solved, but I feel happy and proud if my ideas have solved some of them..

1. Please don't put any Bus stops next to the signals.
2. BMTC buses drivers are going on the right side and when the bus stop comes immediately they are taking left and stopping in bus stop. Please tell them to take left for bus stop at least 500 mts before it.
3. Don't allow heavy vehicles to travel during peak hours.
4. Its very appreciable that you have built foot over bridges for crossing roads at main centers but people are not utilizing it properly. Make strict rules to use that. So that the vehicles can move freely if no pedestrian obstructs the flow.
5. At some centers the BMTC buses, private buses and some cabs also stopping their vehicles irrespective of bus stop positions. Pass strict orders to stop the vehicles exactly at the  bus stops. 
     .           .
Do not use high beam light within city limits. Switch to low beam light. Help others to drive safely.

Respected Sir,

 As the F.I.R was delayed by Honest, Sincere Police staffs of   Kadugondana Halli Police Station Bangalore from 31.01.2015 to 13.03.2015 made Mr. Zubber Ahmed run from one pillar to other why?
same as in the case mentioned below 
Despite orders by a City court, directions from the Centre and a missive from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, the Bangalore Police are yet to take action against a police inspector charged
with extorting money from two Chinese nationals, besides supporting illegal transport of red sanders.
The Chinese nationals then approached Cubbon Park sub-inspector (SI) Bharath on December 20. When the SI contacted Bhaskar, he told him not to entertain their plea and directed the SI against bringing the matter to the notice of higher authorities.
http://www.deccanherald.com/content/437282/home-minister-shielding-errant-cop.html 22-Oct-14

 Dated 31.01.2015 apart from abusing in front of summoning authority @ Kadugondana Halli Police Station Syed Khaleel Pasha @ Syed Qualeelulla Quadri got down his car, waylaid, restricted movements & started abusing with filthy language I Urdu to Mr. Zubber Ahmed (who was alone which summoning authority also knows better) the just outside the main entrance of Kadugondana Halli Police Station after he left the summoning authority walking towards his house.
Immediately this was brought to the Notice of summoning authority @ Kadugondana Halli Police Station which he informed all this is common get out.
Now the same Sincere Police authority @ Kadugondana Halli Police Station is asking now for witnesses and issued a notice to Mr. Zubber Ahmed Ref. No.  Kindly let us know why is he asking now 13.03.2015 why not he did the same thing on 13.03.2015?
Are any special rules laid for Kadugondana Halli Police Station officials By The Honorable Apex Court or The Honorable Karnataka High Court or MHA.

 When contacted Kadugondana Halli Police Station PI SRI T. Srinivas in the Month of February 2015 upon personal directions of Area DCP @ DCP office as per telephonic Instructions by The Bangalore City Police Commissioner Office to Area DCP later PI Sri T. Srinivas after arriving to Kadugondana Halli Police Station warned him stating that are you stable and know against whom your filing case, upon Mr. Zubber asking him why did your subordinates  retained documents & sent me for which Sri T. Srinivas informed its a waste letter even we cannot give NCR is it true?

 The day when Mr. Zubber lastly came to your office to meet you after telephonic appointment & your confirmation which can be verified from visitors gate register & CCTV footages, where he met DCP East through Bangalore City Police Commissioner Office clerical staff and he took away the grievance letter by informing he will brief you, what action has been till date against the accused?
 As  per written in kannada in the FIR copy 114/2015 kgps
Whether only written statement is compulsory or oral is also acceptable for uneducated complainants. 
 Please I pray for the answers in written of the above points so Mr. Zubber Ahmed (Uneducated) can present the same in The Honorable Court.

 Kindly request to hand over the case to CID or The Honorable Lokayukta so they can provide Witness to Mr. Suresh PSI  Honest, Sincere Police staffs of   Kadugondana Halli Police Station Bangalore as he can witness an produce accordingly before The Honorable Court.

Yours sincerely

My name is Chhavi and I had to call '100' for an emergency - my nephew was beaten by a bus conductor over ticket issue. 
I talked to 100 line operatory once and they send some police constable to the spot. After that no one bothered to  pick the call on '100'. Is this some sort of joke? Is this number for 24X7 emergency or just time pass.
I made 5 calls on '100' on 15th march 2015 and only one was answered.

Please give me another no where we can call in emergency.

Just wanted to let you know the efficient work of our Yeshwanthpur police station staff and PI.
Last month i had reported Bandi vendors blocking traffic in Bombay dyeing main road after which it was forwarded to our Yeshwanthpur police station.
I am glad to see that even till today our police are following up on this issue and issuing warning to these vendors which has helped alot in allowing free flow of traffic in this road.

With all due respect please convey our regards to Yeshwanthpur PI and Staff.
Not to forget the efficient admins of this page who are managing these requests efficiently .

Thank you for all your help.

Please Remove useless traffic signal from JP morgan (i dont understand on whose stupid idea this useless signal is applied and wasted public money in this shit) ..

instead construct a Footbridge (skywalk) (like one constructed in Marathahalli bridge) ...

At JP morgan ..only people have to cross the road nothing else required but still a uselesssignal applied over there for increasing traffic jamm.. 

construct required footbridge so that :

1.traffic jamm will be reduced

2. the advertisement hordings which u'll put on the footbridge those rent will recover the construction cost in some months and later ..department will get extra money for other development.
\

Requesting u guys to please stop following ur pathetic idea of applying traafic signal everywhere and construct what exactly needed at places like JP Morgan..

and dost reply that u have forwarded this to nearby traffic inspector ..as that fellow will not take decision..forward it to concern person and if possible reply the response of that concern person... because everytime every request forwarded to concern person but that person is actually missing as no action taken anywhere

Hi Bangalore City Police,

Just wanted to let you know the efficient work of our Yeshwanthpur police station staff and PI.
Last month i had reported Bandi vendors blocking traffic in Bombay dyeing main road after which it was forwarded to our Yeshwanthpur police station.
I am glad to see that even till today our police are following up on this issue and issuing warning to these vendors which has helped alot in allowing free flow of traffic in this road.

With all due respect please convey our regards to Yeshwanthpur PI and Staff.
Not to forget the efficient admins of this page who are managing these requests efficiently .

Thank you for all your help.

Yesterday, A blue bag fell off from a white car while it was passing through Psn.
Bikers suddenly stopped n then for more than two hours waited for the owner.
But none turned out.
Went n gave it to Whitefield Law & order station.
They opened the bag to find two blankets, zen brand phone without sim card,blue handkerchief, pan card of bombay address, belt,parachute coconut oil bottle,phone charger,data card wires and SBI card...(about which I learnt that its new way to access to the account without filling out the deposit wagara types slips)

Now the staff got into action to find out the owner.
 Respect the way they took the responsibilities! Salutes to them!
Thankful for the help from Whitefield L&O team.
Looked like a watchman or a cabbie working on night shift wale ka handbag!
It went to right hands!
 It was around 9.45 am at prestige shantiniketan gate one! Traveling towards big bazaar.

 In all probability, the bag was just casually kept on the roof of the car. Driver didn't know it.
Must have halted to talk with someone. And after chatting, he must have driven away.
Completely unaware of the bag on the roof.
Maybe the owner of the bag too didn't realise it...
So when people tried to stop the car,he said I have n had no bag!

 Hopefully the bag has found the owner by now.
Looked like a hardworking person who took care of himself at night in this weather!
Not all can afford to buy a charger n phone!
It was carefully wrapped up in blanket. To keep away from oil bottle and damage.

Sometimes the belongings are of emotional value and above the money values!

Thank you #Bangalorecitypolice Whitefield law and order station and it's staff.

Sir,   2nd Main, First Cross, PAI Layout, OMR, There is a illegal business complex at the corner, where Phoenix Fitness is there. Also there are Eating joints below in this building. The Gym puts loud noises from morning 5:30 till night 10 pm and this is causing a lot of problems to neighbors, residents.  the ground area is used by all the street people as their resting and non sense place. Eating joints are also not maintain the standards and causing health risk to people. Kindly take action on this building owner and cancel the license for all these activities other than making it as a residential place

A seat belt, sometimes called a safety belt, is a safety harness designed to secure the occupant of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result from a collision or a sudden stop. As part of an overall occupant restraint system, seat belts are intended to reduce injuries by stopping the wearer from hitting hard interior elements of the vehicle or other passengers (the so-called second impact) and by preventing the passenger from being thrown from the vehicle.

Alternatively spelled seatbelt, as a compound word. 
Dear Mr. Commissioner,

Are you not able to see the practical problems a common man is facing during the rallies at Freedom Park. RU under pressure from the government or are you not interested in making life easier for the people who are going to work, hospital, court's............students going to colleges.....

Because of these rallies:

Today nearly 07 warrants were issued by the magistrates of a particular ACMM. The reason is the accused were struck in the traffic and could not come to the court on the stipulated time.

Now your officials will harass the accused by saying a warrant is issued by the court..They will also extort money and let him recall his warrant....

To recall his warrant he will have to spend money and time. He has to hire a lawyer and go to court at least 02 times to recall his warrant.....

Please try to understand that by giving permission to such rallies your department is really harassing the general public...

Trust me, you have still not understood the mood of the general public...If this continue's than you will be seeing a rally in front of your office for creating a nuisance to the common man.... 
What suo moto action have you taken on this story????

Dear BCP - few days back I had posted a  fake car selling trying to sell marinara XUV500 at less than half the market price, and he is a scamster who is trying to get advance money transfers to his account by giving fake promised. Today the same guy has posted another ad in different name and different car - Maruti swift 2013 at only rs.350000 and again asking for advance to his bank account. This is a pure scam and a fraudster trying to scam people and their money. Though I got immediate revert from BCP that the complaint has been forwarded to the crime dept. Still I see no action and the fraudster still operating openly and duping people. This fraudster can be reached at 99 80 177212. He seems to be from Nigeria.

This time please take serious action. 
Hi Respected Sir/Madam,
On 05/03/15 i have met with accident near Command Hospital Domlur. On that day 05/03/15 around 9.45 am i have passed command hospital signal and was moving slowly in my bike suddenly the Innova Car (No# KA 04 B 9069) (Dell Company Cab) hits the silencer of the bike in seconds, i could not able to control unfortunately fell down, got hurt to Knee/elbow/palm there was bleeding. Innova car driver stopped his car and came to me suddenly he and one Dell employee started scolding and pointing me that i have done the mistake... these people are humans, atleast they dint asked me ' is everything ok or do we need to go to hospital' other than this they are shouting on me.... i was in shock could not able to speak anything.... they dint even thought that how could i go to hospital, finally the car driver and the Dell employee left me alone in road and went from the place.... is these people are humans?.. they don't have humanity?... they dont have atleast concern to take to hospital?.... if the same thing happens to there family members will they do the same?..... i have also contacted the rash driving people in call but the reply was ' sir we will brief to the driver that he wont do the mistake again' this was the reply. 
BTP Sir/Madam, accidents are not incidents. accidents are not done intentionally so we cant blame anyone. But as a human we need to see that the person who got injured will reach the safe place for treatment or atleast for First Aid... what happened in my case was really horrible, the car dirver and Dell employee has not bothered about the injured person. Sir i will update the picture of Innova Car and the person standing beside car is an Dell employee. please take an action.. Thank You

Your persons are taking the vehicle (two wheeler) even though we have not parked in NO PARKING area , we have no opportunity to make any representation to prove that we are not parked in no parking area.

While taking the vehicle you are making so many scratches to the vehicle and if we ask , answer from your side is "go and claim the insurance, we are not responsible for that" such a rude behavior..!!! In police station there is no authorized person to take or collect the fine and to give receipt. If we ask, they will reply like  "Nilli sir, wait madi nim urgentige illi  enu agalla idu police stationnu". How much time we have to wait, Today I have waited for more then (around 12.45 pm) two hours and I have visited two times for collecting the receipt in basavanagudi police station, and paid Rs.300 even though I could not get the receipt finally I went without taking the receipt, and there that guy asked for Original DL to get the bill actually I used to carry copy of DL i.e. laminated colour xerox. Kindly inform me should we need to carry the original DL  ..?

After waiting for such a long time also I am not able see any of the police officer face, that is the worst part of it. Finally I learned a lesson that " for others mistake also we have to waste our whole day"

Thank You BTP 
Dear Commissioner of Police, 

Could you please stop your beat constables from collecting money from street vendors?  It is the single most damaging thing to the image of the police, to be seen collecting "hafta" from street vendors and petty shops!   

I know people of high integrity who work in the police department.  But everyday, when I see a 'hoysala' beat patrol jeep openly stopping at every petty shop on a street and collecting "hafta", my respect for the force hits rock bottom!  The policemen are even tactless enough to use the police beacon at times, to remind the guys to hurry up!  Such misuse of state authority and that too with impunity? 

Is this the image you wish the police to have?  Shouldn't it invoke respect among the people, instead of revulsion and contempt? 
why there is no action against the people who attacked Africans... is this is the way we behave with our guests... hope u understand that millions of Indians are in Africa and elsewhere, who safety is in danger because of your inability to do things right... file FIR and bring all the criminals to face charges... they should be charged under goonda act 
100% true sir 

Please drive safe always

Four persons arrested in Kamakshipalya PS with 5 antique idols worth Rs 1.5 crore. 
Dear Sir/Madam,

This morning(12th of March, 2015) I boarded an auto from Ejipura Signal to Agara Lake which is my regular route to office. While travelling in the auto, the driver was to take a left turn before Sony world signal(drainage adjacent road) and a lady aged around 30 was crossing the road. The auto driver showing no patience to the woman crossing rammed into her injuring her hand on the spot. Despite my repeated attempts, he did not stop the vehicle and dropped me at the by lanes near Maharaja signal, Koramangala and fled the scene. He instead explained that woman of today's society deserve it. He was expressing his views of the society which are socially unacceptable. I am also under the impression that this auto driver was heavily sedated or drunk since he was barely able to speak well or drive well. I went back to the same spot to find the lady but she was not there anymore.

I write with angst that though physically strong, I did not assault this auto driver as I knew that would amount to criminal charges against myself and it was not right to take the law into my hand. Hence, I write to you to take strict action against the driver of Auto Number: KA 03 D 7267. I am not sure if the lady is in a position after this shocking incident to even report this incident. If required, I am ready to cooperate in identifying the auto driver if he is caught. I believe, its the duty of everyone to keep bangalore city safe and ensure harmony. I am sure, you will do the needful by teaching this inhuman driver a lesson.

Awaiting your response.

Eunuchs continue to create havoc at every #traffic signal in #Bangalore what are you doing to address this.Last evening at Udipi gardens signal 1 eunuch asked money from a biker who was returning from work as he had a bag and was in his formals, when he denied, this eunuch literally checked his shirt pocket and then fondled him between his legs.All the biker could do is shake his head in embarrassment.If a girl meets something similar there his huge cry about it.Who will understand the pain and helplessness of bikers especially males.Need help. It happens on all traffic signals, Silk Board, Hosa Road, Udipi Gardens, Jaydeva flyover to name a few. 
+914466391300 - getting calls from this number and on picking the call we get to hear a ivr message "we are facing difficulties, call back later". so curios people try to search this number in true caller where it prompts to login using yahoo or google account... this might be a trick to get personal information in our accounts or something... kindly investigate... 
Dear Sir,  we stay in 1st E cross, pipelane road, mathikere, bangalore - 560054, near flag post. I believe smoking in public places is punishable, but I have seen people buy cigarettes from corner shop just opposite to our house and smoke happily in front of our house, and most of the people gather in that corner, I don't know what business these people have, to stand in that corner, ladies are bit scared of these people, to come out of the house, or leave girl children alone at home, request the concerned authorities to patrol regularly in this area and take some action against those who smoke and stand there. 
Dear City Police Team

We are the flat owners of DS Max Sprinkles Apartment in Kodathi Village, Carmelaram Post, Sarjapura Road, Bangalore - 560035.

The road to our apartment comes from nearby village Hadosiddapura & in last few weeks many times few small attempts of chain snatching, eve teasing & attempt of robbery has happened with flat owners, To be exact on the road in front of BMTC flats.

On the top there is no electric lights on the road mentioned above & because of which it is a soft target spot.

Can you add this area into regular police patrolling so that these kind of incidents get stopped?

Dear Friends, Be alert of such messages. Block them. Please do not fall prey to such fraudsters. 
Sir, with due respect, you have made #lifeinbangalore easier for people with your prompt actions. Today we booked an #Olacab and because there was so much traffic, the driver of our cab started yelling and threatening our lives because he was having to deal with traffic because of picking us up. We had to stop the cab halfway and get down as we were scared for our lives. The cab driver's name was Radhakrishnan and his vehicle number is Toyota Innova White colour KA 03 AA 7056. 

I believe he has never driven in the city before Sir, he might cause an accident as he was driving in a very rash manner.

Respected Police Commissioner ,
Peepal Tree Cutting for building temple.
Its nice to see post by BCP on stopping noise pollution. But posting is not enough. I had complained through facebook about noise problem by temple in Ittamadu. Not just me but many other complained to the police. I recently came to know that police came to talk with the pujari and he just mentioned the name of the local leader who supports his temple business. The police went away doing nothing. We r still bearing the loudspeaker and bell problem  even now during exams.  Now worse is that he has cut a very big portion of peepal tree  to build a proper temple beneath it. It was a beautiful tree where few people liked to sit beneath it. We don't need temple when there is already one just opposite to it. trees like peepal are very important. If police had taken proper action in the past then may be this could have been avoided.  No one has complained now because there is no faith in police left anymore.  Its also surprising if permission was given to cut the tree on what basis and importance was it given and why no NOC from local residents. Citizens are very upset about this ancient tree cutting. 
Dear Bangalore Police,

First of all, thanks for the great work you guys are doing.

I want to bring to your notice, a lapse in safety arrangements for fire hazards by the organizers of:

Sunday Soul Sante (8th March, 2015)
SUNDAY SOUL SANTE: Women's Day Special
Embassy International Riding School

There was a fire incident in the parking lot of the event, in which my car was gutted and to my surprise not a single fire extinguisher, fire brigade was called for by the event organizers even after 3 hrs of the incident. They also seem to take the issue very lightly. The organizers should be audited and appropriate action should be taken.

Thanks

Indian oil petrol bunk at chandra layout is cheating people openly.
today i went there and asked for 200 rupess worth of petrol to be filled in my bike, the attendent very smartly just filled petrol of 132rupees and quickly reset the meter. They were using a hose that comes from roof which has a very small display. At first i was a doubt and was not use but when i confronted them, the entire staff of the petrol bunk didnt say a word and accepted by payment of 132 rupees. 
          i kindly request you to take action on it. i dont have any proof of this as all of it happened on the spot. i m just 1 who caught there cheat but they might be doing to 100 of customer everyday. Seems like the entire staff the petrol bunk is involved in cheating people.

Dear Bangalore Traffic Police and Bangalore City Police, 
couple of months ago there was a drive/action towards the Autos in Bangalore..but I don't think the auto drivers have learnt any lesson out of it. Their daylight robbery continues.. 
Autos continue to create nuisance to public, demand excess fare without any hesitation. 
As an example, the Autos from Hosa Road junction to SIlk Board, they are demanding Rs.150 to 200, and don't ever turn on the meters. Request you to take stringent action at the earliest. 
What we should do, if police do not want to lodge FIR for a theft ? If there is any rule which says that police can decline FIR for crime like theft ? 
Wishes to super cop and dynamic officer Shri Alok Kumar sir a many more and more happy returns of the day to you and God bless you with all success and happiness in ur life and may all ur dreams come true sir

Another incident of electronics theft (including laptops and mobile) in Marathahalli area:

19th february,2015. a theft (of around 4 lakhs)took place at our flat in munnekolala.
We filed an FIR (FIR no. 0143/2015) in H.A.L police station on the very same day and since then we are waiting for the police to take some action.
3-4 days after the theft, we received a call from the guy(from his own number) who was having one of our stolen mobile phones(iphone-6) asking for some ransom money. We informed police about the same and gave them the number(that we got a call from) to track, but the sad part is, though that mobile number is still active, but there has been no action taken by the police department.
We have even got the facebook profile of that person which is having a clear photograph of that guy which could help police to track him easily.

This is not a single incident that has happened in this area, and all the incidents have been reported in H.A.L police station, but there is no update on any of them.

After providing so much of information to the police, we feel helpless that the thief is not yet tracked. We request Bangalore City Police Bangalore City Police Bangalore Policeto take some action on this case as soon as possible.

After allowing traffic from the Unity Building side for well over 3 minutes while stopping traffic from the Ravindra Kalakshetra side they once again allowed traffic from Unity building side after barely allowing 3 autos to pass while the pile up on the Kalakshetra side kept increasing.

Invariably happens when auto is turned to manual. We need to have synchronised signals at all times from  JC Road junction(near old Shivaji theatre) to Kempegowda Circle.

Dear Respected sir, My sincere advise to BCP is why dont you bring more number of Reserve police into road and catch the People who drives the vehicle without helmet and Licence, I have seen more number of school children and college students who drives without the above, and Reserve police can work on the road wherever there is huge traffic jams, Please think over and bring the rule so that you can gain lot of money interms of fine and it can be extra fund for Government.

Yesterday(5/3/2014) in the morning, I had to wait for an hour before I could find an honest auto driver that didn't overcharge or refuse. (My destination is barely 10 minutes away.) I have the Bangalore Traffic Police's app on my phone which I use religiously to report rogue auto drivers. So, after another auto guy refused, (after 20 autos or so) I took down his number (KA01 AC5474), and like every scumbag driver in this city, he began arguing for the sake of arguing. I told him that refusing with the "for hire" sign was against the law. At that point, a Bangalore City Police officer was passing by on his motorcycle, so I called out to him.
Now, the first thing I noticed was this policeman didn't have his name tag displayed. (Every cop is required by law to display it at all times.) I told this very passive cop what had happened, both in Kannada and English. Then the auto guy told him his version, acting as if he hadn't broken any laws, later he began claiming he had a fever. His attitude towards the cop was nonchalant, as if he'd knew he'd get away with it. Even the cop looked like he didn't care, so I asked him who's side he was on. I asked the driver why he was on the road driving around with his "for hire" sign on if he was really sick.

I was expecting the cop to call someone over at the Bangalore Traffic Police Station to take care of this auto driver on the spot. But he told me to just take down the auto number and complain, I told him I'd already done that and that he should do something more about this. He said he'd help me get an auto. Now, I was getting really late for work, so I obliged. And you won't believe what happened next.

The first auto the cop hailed refused to take me to my destination (KA03 B2036). Well, nothing new here, happens everyday to thousands of people in this city. But, THE AUTO DRIVER REFUSED IN FRONT OF OUR VERY OWN Bangalore City Police. The auto took off, and the policeman just stood there doing nothing with the goofiest smile on his face. I stood there, confused, trying to register what I'd just seen. How on earth can an auto driver refuse a commuter in front of a cop? I asked him why he didn't do anything to stop the auto. He was letting an auto guy get away scot-free even though he'd just witnessed the driver break the law first hand. He told me he couldn't do anything since he wasn't a traffic cop. I told him he should've stopped the auto from getting away and handed him over to the traffic police.

Disgusted with his behaviour and in attempt to find out his identity, I asked him if he was aware of the fact that a policeman should display his name tag at all times while on duty, to which he said it was broken. I asked him what his name was, to which he answered, "Hari." (Of course, I don't believe him. You know, corrupt Indian cops and all.)
Me: And you second name, sir?
Cop: I'm not telling you.
Me: Not only did you not try to stop a traffic offender, but your name tag is missing while on duty and you are refusing to reveal your identity.
Cop: Silence.
Me: I'm sorry, you seemed like you were going to help. But I have to report you as well. Please tell me your name.
Cop: Silence.
Me: I don't have a choice except taking a picture of your licence plate number. You are not above the law.
The cop tries snatching my phone out of my hand (Indian cops hold a master's degree in phone-snatching), but I managed to get a picture.

So, Bangalore City Police, let me get this straight, an auto driver breaks the law right in front of one of your men and he fails to take action. You are a disgrace to the country.

And Bangalore Traffic Police, yes, this whole thing happened because of you. I have reported hundreds of autos and I have complained about the auto situation in HSR Layout with no action being taken whatsoever. The auto drivers do not fear you, they do not respect you, and will continue breaking the law until the end of time because I have not seen any difference in the way this racket operates.

So, what do you have to say about one of your men failing to take action in spite of witnessing someone break the law?

I will not take answers like, "Your complaint has been lodged and has been intimated to the concerned police department." That is very easy for you to say, but tell me how does a police officer not take action when his only job and responsibility to uphold the law? Will he get fired for this or will he get away like all the VIPs with criminal backgrounds that you serve and clear the roads for?

All I ask is to do your job, because the salaries through which you are paid is OUR TAX MONEY. And when we pay our taxes, we expect you to do your job because you don't do it for free and you are not doing the public a favour.

Waiting for your answer.

Sir, 
please can you have a barricade placed showing the one way sign on the road which connects from old madras road after RMZ Building to the underpass which connects Kasturinagar, as there is lots of chaos and traffic jam because of 2 way traffic, actually this should be one way from Kasturinagar connecting the Old madras road and there was a barricade placed but unfortunately its been removed and we have no idea why this happened, please can you do the needful at the earliest. 
From Urvashi Theatre to Double Road complete FOOTPATHS on both sides has been Encroached by shopkeepers displaying and stocking their material. Pedestrians are forced to walk on road risking their lives. I had complained about one month back to Bangalore Traffic Police, when traffic was diverted to Siddhiah Road during repair work. But no action was taken till today. Bangalore City Police do not take any action till somebody dies like on Bellary road. 
Dear sir, please install speed brakers on Kanakapura road with reflectors ... there are none of them from Jp nagar 6th phase signal towards Metro.... tankers, lorries buses and other heavy vehicles are creating life threatening situations to other commuters on this newly laid stretch under metro flyover....kindly look into this and save lives...

Hi Bangalore City Police ,

I am writing this post to thank you and specially our Yeshwanthpur police station staff and inspector.
When i wrote my previous post on Bundi vendors blocking traffic and emergency vehicles in Narayanswamappa rd(bombay dyeing rd or 1st main rd) with all hope and respect to see some action and our department did not disappoint us.

Immediate action was taken by Yeshwanthpur Police and vendors were moved out of main road which has eased traffic on this road especially during evenings.

Please convey our sincere Thanks to Yeshwanthpur police station staff.
And not to forget all admins of Bangalore City Police ...

Once again a heartfelt thanks to all of you hope to see same situation maintained on this road in future..

There has been many cases of cycle theft around 4th phase and RWF Quarters of Yelahanka New Town in the recent weeks. But Yelahanka New Town Police are sleeping. Pl. wake them. 
 Do not over-speed.

This is to bring to your kind notice..

Today, the road leading to Sri Dharmagiri Manjunatha swamy temple was dug up to put high tension electric wire for a very "Influential" person who is constructing his house next to the temple.

After a lot of Chaos and resistance from the local residents, they have reporarily stopped the work.

Request the city police to take action for the following :
1. The road which was dug is a public road - After 4 years, they had asphalted this road a few months back - Now who will asphalt the road

2. The sewage line on the 35th cross has not been changed for the past 30 years and constantly overflows every year during rainy season - No body bothered to repair that - However gave permission to lay high tension cable on the same side of the sewage line.

3. Will some action be taken against the people who dug the road ?

4. Will some action be taken on people who gave permission to put the high tension cable ?

Attached is the Photographs as proof of the activity.

Any action on this would be highly appriciated.

Can the police assist the BTP in coming up with some plan to clear the traffic mess at KR puram. Day after day, this is just getting worse with no fix in place.  Police needs to make some decisions like no parking of trucks and buses on the road sides, install a signal near the merging point of Old madras road and outer ring road, create a bus lane from the outer ring road flyover till the under bridge of the flyover in front of KR Puram station. 
 Accident near Tin Factory.Traffic towards city affected. People from Mahadevpura and ITPL requested to take alternate routes.

Dear Sir, 

I have reported laptop theft that happened at my home on 4th morning around 3. 30 to 3. 45 to Mahadevapura police station.  Fir number is 0157/2015.  Two laptops have been stolen from bed room through window using a rod.  One laptop is my HP office laptop and another Dell personal laptop.  
Apart from just thinking that we had to keep the bed room window closed, is there a possibility of recovering them?? 

Kindly help as the police in Mahadevapura station say 99% we cannot recover it.  Is it really true that we cannot recover it  at all??  

Thanks 
Happy Holi Wishes to All. 
Today, Yelahanka New Town Police refused to take my complaint on cycle theft and told to give at as cycle 'lost'. The only good heart in Bangalore police, Shri M.N. Reddy re-tweeted to advice me to lodge complaint at Mantri Mall FIR booth, (15 km from my home). Now my question, will Karnataka Police become humans atleast in the next 68 years of Independence and democracy ??? 
I met the DCP in Koramangala and she tells that they will do the search from their end and will find the phone. And regarding the company and what ever they have given in writing will no way be considered by them. 
I wanted to lodge a complaint with Yelahanka New Town Police regarding theft of my bicycle. They refused to register and said to give complain as cycle 'lost' instead of 'theft' !!! I tweeted to good Shri MN Reddy Sir and he suggested to file complaint at Mantri Mall FIR booth. Now I have to travel 15  km (one way ) to lodge complaint. Hope Karnataka police would get better atleast in the next  68 years of Independence.

I marcel spielmann a resident in adugodi , had lost my apple iphone 4 in a company (INFOSEEK LIGHTMASS BTM) by handing it to Nancy the trainer, i attended interview their same day was asked to join. i accepted the offer and i attended the training on the same day (19th december 2015). During the training we were all asked to handover the phone to the trainer. and during dinner when i asked for my phone she was not able to return. 
Inspite of me having lost my iPhone I was also asked to not come back to to work. I reported the same to the area police station and an FIR 1670/2014 is filed and its almost 3 months and the police are negligent. 
The person from the company management has also written and given on the 3rd of FEB 2015 stating that he will replace the same or another second hand phone which is functioning by the 28th of FEB 2015 (this happened in front of the sub inspector of the madiwala police station) and is not adhering to his own word and refusing to respond.
And they are also irrespectful and talking in favor of the company.
I need some justice and I need some help from you kindly do the needful.

Thank you

Post details: Earlier opening of median was unscientific and due to which many road accidents took place.Nearly 6 accidental deaths have reported  during 2014 & after altering the median not even a single accident had taken place in the past  5 months.
 
REPLY: welcome your Suggestion to open median at IOCL Petrol bunk. This is very much necessary & needed as BMTC buses will take U turn at Kempegowda Arch, traffic congestion @ peak hours is mainly due to BMTC buses taking U turn not because of opening median, Yes definitely will take Public opinion to redesign the new openings.

This is in relation with the harrasment bangalore police is downing upon the citizens of bangalore. I was returning from my friends house at 1:45 AM in rajarajeshwari nagar and was stopped unneccesarily by 2 patrol police personels near my house. on observing the vehicle of the personels  to be a civilian vehicle i.e an Honda activa bearing the registeration number KA-41-EB-5714 i refused to stop fearing to get robbed or muged by fake police. on takiing an another route to my house the guys came back and forced me to stop. i stopped unwillingly and to my suprise the police personel serving in rajarajeshwari nagar police station named MR.B.YATNAM came charging upon me with a lathi stick and was hurling abuses on me for not stopping. On my questioning that what have i done wrong he abused me profusely and told that ""THE COMMISIONER HAS ORDERED NO ONE CAN ROAM IN THE NIGHT AND ANY VEHICLE SEEN ON ANY ROAD IN THE NIGHT IS BOUND TO BE STOPPED"". He wanted me to leave my vehicle at the same place and to carry on with him to the police station without any proper reason. On requesting him to leave me this time he started abusing me again and said "" WHERE ARE U FROM ??"" to which i replied ""I AM FROM BIHAR"". To which the guy replied ""TUM BIHAR KA LOG IDHAR AAKE KACHRA KAR DIYA HAI"".

I being a reputable citizen of this country have the decision completely on my discretion that which state i choose to live in and when ever i want to roam on the roads and there should be no one to ask me about that. This behaviour of the cops is increasing amongst the lower level staff and the amount of harrasment to be faced by people is nerve wrecking. I request the COMMISIONER OF POLICE to please take action on this issue as soon as possible and take strict action against the cop so that no other fool tries to repeat this mistake. 
Can the Auto driver reject the travel in bangalore city limit? if No, what are the ways to complain? 
Auto drivers attacking and man handling on people if they ask them to put meter near Jalahalli cross, hesaragatta road, 8th mile.  this is general problem people around this area facing.

Why no response on this ?
Please respond.

Writing again the problem:
This is regarding the 2 + 2 illegal, unscientific speed breakers, constructed on Sarjapur road near Kaikodranhalli Lake 2 weeks back. They are actually vehicle-breakers, neck-breakers and back-breakers.
While at many places, such illegal and un-scientific speed breakers have been destructed or converted into scientific ones, why these newly constructed to break the back and neck of motorists ???
I have tweeted 3-4 times in last 2 weeks but no response from your side.
- Had you recommended them?
- Were you not informed before their construction?
Let me know whatever information you have, I will take it to Bangalore City Police attention and if required, want to file report.

This for BIJAPUR (vijayapur) Superintendent of Police and Karnataka Police.... What is use of all this Education when youre only good to market your qualification with small time thief and politician (Mean taking pic with them) When you cannot get fair justice to senior WOMAN citizen even after 1 year .... SHAME ON your Bijapur Police officers, who support abuse on senior WOMAN citizen,when they have divert disciplinary action initiated against IND CPI by honest and humble Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SIPAT and DSP BY Belubi . Who did fair investigation and requested for department disciplinary action against IND CPI. These two officers have honored Honorable president request for fair investigation which they have demonstrated as senior officers... These officers are transferred now.. Now, present SP D Prakash and DSP Jinendra Khanagavi have diverted the case and even they have gone ahead and reversed the disciplinary action against INDI CPI  Even they have not realized that they have ignored honored Honorable president request for fair investigation and justice for WOMAN senior citizen. I have asked Honorable president office via RTI what action can be initiated against the civil servant officers who ignore Honorable president requisition. I have filled complaint to NEW SP D Prakash saying DSP Jinendra Khanagavi has submitted Fake report without any substance you need to be mindful before concluding anything on the case I can openly challenge DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report with SP and whole Karnataka police  Now this officer says I can challenge their order in court which I will do. Is this not MOCKERY of LAWwhy govt waste taxpayer money on these officers for their monthly pay stubs,when every case needs to knock the court door

Hi , 
Please find complete investigation copy on your FAN PAGE, going forward I will update more as when available.
Find below URL detail report of the investigation 
https://www.dropbox.com//Bijapur%20Pol%20BOG%20Investigati 
Once you go through this report, you will fairly understand ex Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT and Additional DSP BY Belubi have sincerely & professionally respected senior WOMAN CITIZEN on her compliant and initiated disciplinary action against INDI  Taluq Circle Police Inspector. Also Ex Belgum IG Bhaskar RAO has given clear direction for disciplinary action against INDI Taluq CPI..
When the Incident happened, IG Bhaskar RAO was bought into radar immediately, and he spoke to EX Bijapur SP Ajay Hilori  What Ajay Hilori has conveyed to Bhaskar ROA is not captured in any of the investigation report. I will share SP Ajay Hilor conversation when incident happened if required. 
Now if you read Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report you will get to know his report is bogus and fake without any substance and diverting whole case . Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi doesnt have any clue IG Bhaskar Rao was in radar when incident happened. IG Bhaskar Rao himself asked me to approach Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT saying his he is nice SP he will help. 
Shocked and Surprised, how can present SP D Prakash can conclude Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report and reverse the disciplinary action against INDI Taluq CPI reverse Acton on this case embarrasses ALL the WOMAN mother and daughters.
Importantly honest officer like Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT and Additional DSP BY Belubi have been DISHONORED AND THEIR INVESTIGATION IS TREATED VOID. 
What SP D Prakash & Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi wants to prove now, whether they are giving protection to Woman or expert in manipulating the case to protect their own officer 
Is there any justice, Protection for WOMAN by Karnataka Police? 
Please look into this as sensitive issue on WOMAN SENIOR Citizen..

We have been running a seafood wholesale business at the Yeshwanthpur Fish market for the last 45 years. Yesterday a Sub inspector charged two of our employees with petty cases and also physically slapped our labourer claiming that we can not open before 6am. 

Sir, We have opened and run our business peacefully for the last 45 years without causing any hindrance or discomfort to anyone. We open by 3.30 am, which is when the seafood comes in and we close our business by 8.30am. This has been the case for the last 45 years. ( and still continues in other parts of the city including shivajinagar and city market)

Fish being a highly perishable item can not be left unattended for long periods of time, and with the ban on trucks entering the city post 8am, starting the business at 6am becomes untenable, especially trucks bringing fish from different parts of the country.

Sir, we request you to kindly help with the same as police action is turning into harassment for us and creating major hurdles with peacefully running our business. kindly advice on the next course of action.

Thanks

What do you have to say about this?! A few days ago, Bengaluru Traffic Police was lauded for creating a green corridor for an ambulance carrying a live heart.

Hello 

For your kind immediate attention .

 I reside in Austin Town, Bangalore and hire a rick every day to my office which is in Vasant Nagar and today as usual I hired this persons rick from Austin town to go to office around 9:30 and once we neared Shivaji Nagar the auto driver tried to take me in a long wrong route which I normal don't go and I was guiding him the short route to reach office which I take every day but then he stopped in the middle of the road and started abusing me in Kannada . When I informed him that I will inform the cops and won't pay him , He quoted , " Go tell whomever you want , in fact they will just get money from us and won't do anything " and he laughed over it  . After a minute of argument he decided to come on the route which I showed him and he was abusing me in foul language in Kannada all the way  from Shivaji Nagar to Vasant Nagar and once I reached office and paid him , he took the money and literally threw the change and still kept abusing me in Kannada . Finally my office security guys came and chased him from that place. 

I have attached the license details of the auto driver and Kindly request you to take action asap .

Thank You 
What you wanna say for this?

Do you call them cops? He is a rouge in uniform. He has no respect for public. Why should public pay his salary by way of taxes? Police is to protect citizens not to thrash/harm them. If he/cops can't respect citizens of India, he is unfit to be called Police. Do not justify such actions to encourage such rouges cops.

Respected Sir, 

I am giving a suggestion for the smooth running of Ambulance in bangalore City. 

1.  The Ambulance must come in left side of the road
2.  All the vehicle are standing on the road from the start of the signal, all the vehicle standing on the left side must move immediately and gave way to the ambulance. 

3. The ambulance vehicle driver must drive the vehicle on the left side only. 

4.  This will work very well and there is no problem.

5.  Now the ambulance is running haphazardly on the road, they must follow this rule and then see the result.

This for BIJAPUR (vijayapur) Superintendent of Police and Karnataka Police.... What is use of all this Education when youre only good to market your qualification with small time thief and politician (Mean taking pic with them) When you cannot get fair justice to senior WOMAN citizen even after 1 year .... SHAME ON your Bijapur Police officers, who support abuse on senior WOMAN citizen,when they have divert disciplinary action initiated against IND CPI by honest and humble Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SIPAT and DSP BY Belubi . Who did fair investigation and requested for department disciplinary action against IND CPI. These two officers have honored Honorable president request for fair investigation which they have demonstrated as senior officers... These officers are transferred now.. Now, present SP D Prakash and DSP Jinendra Khanagavi have diverted the case and even they have gone ahead and reversed the disciplinary action against INDI CPI  Even they have not realized that they have ignored honored Honorable president request for fair investigation and justice for WOMAN senior citizen. I have asked Honorable president office via RTI what action can be initiated against the civil servant officers who ignore Honorable president requisition. I have filled complaint to NEW SP D Prakash saying DSP Jinendra Khanagavi has submitted Fake report without any substance you need to be mindful before concluding anything on the case I can openly challenge DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report with SP and whole Karnataka police  Now this officer says I can challenge their order in court which I will do. Is this not MOCKERY of LAWwhy govt waste taxpayer money on these officers for their monthly pay stubs,when every case needs to knock the court door

Hi , 
Please find complete investigation copy on your FAN PAGE, going forward I will update more as when available.
Find below URL detail report of the investigation 
https://www.dropbox.com//Bijapur%20Pol%20BOG%20Investigati 
Once you go through this report, you will fairly understand ex Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT and Additional DSP BY Belubi have sincerely & professionally respected senior WOMAN CITIZEN on her compliant and initiated disciplinary action against INDI  Taluq Circle Police Inspector. Also Ex Belgum IG Bhaskar RAO has given clear direction for disciplinary action against INDI Taluq CPI..
When the Incident happened, IG Bhaskar RAO was bought into radar immediately, and he spoke to EX Bijapur SP Ajay Hilori  What Ajay Hilori has conveyed to Bhaskar ROA is not captured in any of the investigation report. I will share SP Ajay Hilor conversation when incident happened if required. 
Now if you read Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report you will get to know his report is bogus and fake without any substance and diverting whole case . Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi doesnt have any clue IG Bhaskar Rao was in radar when incident happened. IG Bhaskar Rao himself asked me to approach Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT saying his he is nice SP he will help. 
Shocked and Surprised, how can present SP D Prakash can conclude Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report and reverse the disciplinary action against INDI Taluq CPI reverse Acton on this case embarrasses ALL the WOMAN mother and daughters.
Importantly honest officer like Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT and Additional DSP BY Belubi have been DISHONORED AND THEIR INVESTIGATION IS TREATED VOID. 
What SP D Prakash & Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi wants to prove now, whether they are giving protection to Woman or expert in manipulating the case to protect their own officer 
Is there any justice, Protection for WOMAN by Karnataka Police? 
Please look into this as sensitive issue on WOMAN SENIOR Citizen.. 
Hats off for taking d decesion on d cop who gav a beating to a responsible citizen.

A Politician with it escort vehicles when travels in the city , traffic comes to a stand still & he moves with its army of escort vehicle. 

But when an "Ambulance" is in an emergency, nobody gives way to him,as it struggles to get its way....some times patient dies & some times patient survives by chance. Cant government bring any specific system so that the ambulance can also gets escorted & reach its destination?

There are many good police men too in the department. But there bad/corrupted are also many. 
Hope this police man's family members, friends are also seeing this video. Hope your parents are not feeling proud of you at all. Hope your wife is not feeling proud of you at all. Hope your child/children is/are not feeling proud of you at all. Hope your friends/colleague will keep distance from you. But still I pray, road should not be block when your parents/wife/children/ or you inside the ambulance. 

From TV news I came to know that you have thrashed an Ex Army person. Remember that is the difference between you & Army person. And that is the reason we too have different attitude towards police & Army. We always feel Army is ours but never feel the same for your department. On duty or off duty or retired army; they are born to help us, but we never expect the same from you. Yes we always have a fear of police men in our mind. For a general individual police means harassment, police means inviting trouble, police means fear.

As a general individual we never find a friend in you.

Murugan: After peaceful Hindu Samajostava, Mangaluru redefined as non communal city. 
Mangaluru: Thanking the general public for a peaceful Hindu Samajostava, City Police Commissioner S. Murugan on Monday said that the public has redefined Mangaluru as a non-communal place, which they once called as a communally sensitive place.

I want to write a blog thanking the public especially. It is they who have redefined  Mangaluru as a a non-communally sensitive place, the top cop told newskarnataka.com at his office.

On the hate speech delivered by Sadhwi Balika Saraswathi Mishra of Madhya Pradesh at Vishwa Hindu Parishads Hindu Samajotsava, he said So far, we have not received a complaint against her speech.

When asked if the police department will take suo moto action against the speaker by registering a case, he said that they have the video record of her speech. We will examine and take appropriate action, Murugan said.

Besides, he mentioned that the organizers too restrained themselves from delivering hate speeches except Sadhvi. He appreciated Pejawar Mutt seer Vishvesha Tirtha, Dharmadhikari of Dharmasthala D. Veerendra Heggade and Vijaya Vittalanatha Shetty president, Swarna Mahotsava Utsava Samiti for promoting communal harmony.

And then there are people like this retired Army officer who went out of the way to help the traffic-struck ambulance. With this act of his, he tried to save a valuable life.

Later, when the old man tried to complain to the senior officer, this policeman tried to forcefully stop him.

@snobfielder He is suspended n enquiry ordered. But let's not generalise. 2k traffic cops work in harsh conditions every day rain or shine!

@raghavramaiah the cop has been already suspended and enquiry ordered. His action is unwarranted. 
There is a gang of around 4-5men of pick pockets who target people in the crowded buses. A person among them drops coins between the seats and forces people to get up from their seats and during this commotion the other people of gang do their work silently and rob people and get down at the next stop. 

This is a scene which happend between the Madiwala - Majestic Bus Stand route. 
Please be aware of such touts! 
Spread as much as possible. 
This is a group of a hindi-urdu speaking gang of 5-6members

What is the problem with that policeman? If he is sick and tired of doing the same job for years..I guess you should consider sending him home permanently. After all, who gave him the right to beat people in the public for no good reason!?

Hi , 
Please find complete investigation copy on your FAN PAGE, going forward I will update more as when available.
Find below URL detail report of the investigation 
https://www.dropbox.com//Bijapur%20Pol%20BOG%20Investigati 
Once you go through this report, you will fairly understand ex Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT and Additional DSP BY Belubi have sincerely & professionally respected senior WOMAN CITIZEN on her compliant and initiated disciplinary action against INDI  Taluq Circle Police Inspector. Also Ex Belgum IG Bhaskar RAO has given clear direction for disciplinary action against INDI Taluq CPI..
When the Incident happened, IG Bhaskar RAO was bought into radar immediately, and he spoke to EX Bijapur SP Ajay Hilori  What Ajay Hilori has conveyed to Bhaskar ROA is not captured in any of the investigation report. I will share SP Ajay Hilor conversation when incident happened if required. 
Now if you read Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report you will get to know his report is bogus and fake without any substance and diverting whole case . Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi doesnt have any clue IG Bhaskar Rao was in radar when incident happened. IG Bhaskar Rao himself asked me to approach Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT saying his he is nice SP he will help. 
Shocked and Surprised, how can present SP D Prakash can conclude Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report and reverse the disciplinary action against INDI Taluq CPI reverse Acton on this case embarrasses ALL the WOMAN mother and daughters.
Importantly honest officer like Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SEPAT and Additional DSP BY Belubi have been DISHONORED AND THEIR INVESTIGATION IS TREATED VOID. 
What SP D Prakash & Additional DSP Jinendra Khanagavi wants to prove now, whether they are giving protection to Woman or expert in manipulating the case to protect their own officer 
Is there any justice, Protection for WOMAN by Karnataka Police? 
Please look into this as sensitive issue on WOMAN SENIOR Citizen..

What is use of all this Education when youre only good to market your qualification with small time thief and politician (Mean taking pic with them) When you cannot get fair justice to senior WOMAN citizen even after 1 year .... SHAME ON your Bijapur Police officers, who support abuse on senior WOMAN citizen,when they have divert disciplinary action initiated against IND CPI by honest and humble Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SIPAT and DSP BY Belubi . Who did fair investigation and requested for department disciplinary action against IND CPI. These two officers have honored Honorable president request for fair investigation which they have demonstrated as senior officers... These officers are transferred now.. Now, present SP D Prakash and DSP Jinendra Khanagavi have diverted the case and even they have gone ahead and reversed the disciplinary action against INDI CPI  Even they have not realized that they have ignored honored Honorable president request for fair investigation and justice for WOMAN senior citizen. I have asked Honorable president office via RTI what action can be initiated against the civil servant officers who ignore Honorable president requisition. I have filled complaint to NEW SP D Prakash saying DSP Jinendra Khanagavi has submitted Fake report without any substance you need to be mindful before concluding anything on the case I can openly challenge DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report with SP and whole Karnataka police  Now this officer says I can challenge their order in court which I will do. Is this not MOCKERY of LAWwhy govt waste taxpayer money on these officers for their monthly pay stubs,when every case needs to knock the court door 
 
 
I have respect to police dept,  but today date 3.3.15 when i saw a PSI rangappa (trafic ps) of sadashivnagar beating a common man just b coz he tried to make way to a ambulance in a medicle emergence 
i like to ask higher officer why this PSI not dismissed if any of the constable was responsible for this then they would took action but they dont do anything to higher ranked officer
the entire insident telecasting live in tv9 news channel 
Congratulations. It is really Great to see a Signal Free GREEN CORRIDOR made by Bengaluru Traffic Police to transport a 'LIVE HEART' carrying an Ambulance.

But you don't care to make way for the Ambulances carrying 'sick Heart patients or Pregnant women'. They are dying on road in the Ambulances when some V.V.I.P. comes.
Are these V.V.I.P.'s are more important than saving a common man's life?

Think it over Mr. Police Commissioner and STOP this V.V.I.P. culture at once. Under no circumstances you should Stop traffic and an Ambulance.
Citizens will respect you, not these Cheap Politicians & V.V.I.P.'s.
Please remember and do the needful. We are a democratic country, not slaves of these Politicians V.V.I.P.'s 
 
 Another Signal Free GREEN CORRIDOR made by Bengaluru Traffic Police to transport a 'LIVE HEART' on 28.2.2015. The Ambulance covered 15 Kms of distance from Victoria Hospital to HAL Airport in just 11 minutes 30 seconds. LIVE HEART had been taken to Global Hospitals, Hyderabad through flight. This was the 4th successful 'GREEN CORRIDOR' made by BTP for transportation of LIVE HEART, since last 6 months.
 Thank you for your kind co-operation.

Dear Sir,
I saw this woman. on the street in chickpet yesterday. She was carrying a baby. I took out some money to give her, but when I saw the baby closer looked like the baby was drugged. The baby was knocked out cold and looked drugged or chloroformed. I questioned the lady and she ran and took to her heels and was really quick and couldn't stop her  What should we do in such circumstances? How do we help as citizens? There is a big chance that the baby is not hers and might be kidnapped, else she might not have bolted.  pl advice, it was painful to see kid being drugged.

Hi Bangalore Traffic Police, I would like to bring to your notice on the menace of the eunuchs on the streets of Bangalore. For the past 3 months I have seen lots of harassing incidents in and around Silk Board crossing. These groups target young boys, harass them and abuse them if they don't pay money. In an incident tonight at 7pm at Silk Board junction, I saw three eunuchs snatching money and beating a college student, the traffic police over there watched it all and remained silent. Somehow I tried to save the boy, then they started abusing and trying to slap me. One of them took out a knife from her/his pocket. It is high time now you people start taking serious actions against these outlaws. Please do something before the situation goes out of hand. 
Sir, please assist in controlling noise pollution at Kundalahalli Gate, Sai Baba Temple Road. Building construction during night hours. This is a residential locality and it is disturbing everyone's sleep. This is an on-going menace. 
Hi BCP,

Bangalore Traffic Police, 

Please take note: This morning at precisely 11.10am, I was driving back home( Sadanand Nagar) from Indira Nagar, I was on Swami Vivekananda Road, Right in front of the metro station when a BMTC bus came in swerving towards the left(I was on the middle lane) and almost banged into me, barely missing me by inches. Luckily, I jammed my brakes and stopped the car. He then swerved in front of me to the left and again swerved to the extreme right! Absolutely ridiculous and rash driving! The traffic light turned red, so he was forced to stop. That is when I had a chance to move up beside him on the left. I opened my window and yelled " What the hell did you think you were doing??" and to this the bus driver responded with lewd and terrible gestures. He beckoned me to come sit on his lap,rubbing his thighs, making kissing faces and winking at me. I was shocked!  I took out my phone and took pics of him, where he actually posed for it! Even when the signal turned green he kept coming towards the left, constantly gesturing at me. This lewd act of his made me feel disgusted, angry, upset, scared, even shame - crazy mixed up emotions. Even the conductor of the bus was laughing. I know there are far worse things happening in the city, but, I'm demanding some action to be taken here as a citizen of this city! Awaiting stern action.Thanks.

Dear sir, Is there no control for autos running in haralur road from AECS layout to sarjapura signal? In morning times there are around 10 to 15 people in each and every auto. In front there are 3 people sitting.Also those drivers are driving rashly taking complete right side in 2 way roads.This is happening daily.As usual people who are following rules need to be afraid of those rowdies and gundas and are driving in sand in road corners.Im writing this in the hope that proper actions will be taken at the earliest..... 
Sir/Madam or Both......This is the 7th time i am complaining with regards to sand laden lorries being parked on the main road behind Viveknagar police station. No action has been taken against these people so that the road stays free for vehicular movement. Request you to kindly look into the same atleast now............NOW I KNOW FOR THE FACT THAT ANOTHER REPLY WOULD BE TYPED BY YOUR TEAM AND NO ACTION TAKEN........................

Broad Day Light Murder of our Innocent Voiceless Indy......!!!!!

One more Brutal Killing was reported by one of my Animal Loving Friend,Mr Sampath. which took place at Hoysala Nagar Under Rama Murthy Nagar Police station Limits on 27/2/2015 between 12.30 pm - 1.00 Pm in Broad day Light in a residential Area....
An 8 year old Sweet Female Indy was hit by an Iron Rod (Meant for turning on/off Water supply valves) while it was sleeping on the pavement of street by local water men,(CMC) who are appointed by local authority to turn water valves on/off...They claim,this sweet Indy had bitten them & others..so they Killed it....
A person to name Mr.Mohan who had taken care of this dog by feeding it from last 8 years,is helpless in filing the case due to the fear of the local goons & an ex-corporate....
Hence,Me,Rachel John,Lisa Ajosh,Anurag Verma,Ravi Narayan & harish approached the cops & filed an FIR @ Rama Murthy Nagar Police Station,against the Monsters who have Brutally killed the sweet innocent creature..
But the pressure is Mounting on the cops & Animal loving residents by some influential people and are trying to destroy all the evidence.They have threatened most of the people to keep quite and do not reveal anything about the killing..
After hitting the innocent creature with an heavy Iron bar,these Monsters have dragged the poor creature its legs tied as it was struggling in pain for life & Death,all the way from the main road and all the shop keepers passers by have seen this,but no one objected or questioned these Monsters,as they are being supported by Politicians. 
Dear All Animal Loving Friends,can u join us & help us to solve this case by making this case more stronger & arresting those Murderers....????? 
I am Afraid, if we let them go so easily,this will encourage them & other Animal Haters to kill more our Innocent,Loving,Voiceless Creatures.....Please Support us to save & help our other Indies 
Sir plzzzz v recommend a bride near tat esteem mall stop as accident had happened ...as a study going towards tat way plzzzz built a bridge r humps ..so tat it may b avoided as per my knowledge

@CPBlr HAL police arrest Murugesh and detect 10 cases of house theft and recover 460gm gold and property worth 16 lakhs. 
Action taken by office of Honble President of India in cases where Civil Servant ignores directions issued on behalf of Honble President of India or direction issued on behalf of President of India.
Honble President of India is highly respected citizen  In case your officer SP/DSP ignores direction issued from President Office for fair trial for senior citizen
What action you initiate against the officer who ignores President of India direction or its ok to ignore Honble President of India orders
Like  
This for BIJAPUR (vijayapur) Superintendent of Police and Karnataka Police.... What is use of all this Education when youre only good to market your qualification with small time thief and politician (Mean taking pic with them) When you cannot get fair justice to senior WOMAN citizen even after 1 year .... SHAME ON your Bijapur Police officers, who support abuse on senior WOMAN citizen,when they have divert disciplinary action initiated against IND CPI by honest and humble Superintendent of Police RAM NIVAS SIPAT and DSP BY Belubi . Who did fair investigation and requested for department disciplinary action against IND CPI. These two officers have honored Honorable president request for fair investigation which they have demonstrated as senior officers... These officers are transferred now.. Now, present SP D Prakash and DSP Jinendra Khanagavi have diverted the case and even they have gone ahead and reversed the disciplinary action against INDI CPI  Even they have not realized that they have ignored honored Honorable president request for fair investigation and justice for WOMAN senior citizen. I have asked Honorable president office via RTI what action can be initiated against the civil servant officers who ignore Honorable president requisition. I have filled complaint to NEW SP D Prakash saying DSP Jinendra Khanagavi has submitted Fake report without any substance you need to be mindful before concluding anything on the case I can openly challenge DSP Jinendra Khanagavi investigation report with SP and whole Karnataka police  Now this officer says I can challenge their order in court which I will do. Is this not MOCKERY of LAWwhy govt waste taxpayer money on these officers for their monthly pay stubs,when every case needs to knock the court door

For reference am attaching complaint and acknowledgement copy ,,,

We All Animal Lovers,From The Bottom of Our Heart,Thank Bengaluru,West Division & Bangalore City Police, And all others, Who have helped in Nabbing these 2 Monsters for Killing our Innocent,Voiceless Creatures...We are Proud of you,Bengaluru City Police.
 The West Division police have arrested two habitual offenders who had poisoned five stray dogs. The police said that they resorted to killing the dogs so that they could carry on with anti-social activities at night
Kindly educate and provide some training to the drivers of KSRTC and BMTC buses. (Private buses too). If they are taught of traffic rules and some common sense required to drive such huge vehicles, half of the traffic problems in the city can be solved. Also impose stricter penalties for not obeying the lane discipline or stopping at random places. 

Thanks.
