Various traffic awareness programme conducted during tr awareness week 
 To create road safety awareness Malleswaram Traffic station conducted painting, sketching , modelling and street play. The programme attended by Sri B. Dayananda, IPS, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Bangalore City.
Now it is 10.35 night and about 5 minutes back I called Control room no 100 about loud speaker noise emanating from IIM. IIM is a prestigious institution and graduates from this institution may become administrators of big cities in future. But how can we expect good administration from them when they themselves disturb the peaceful night of Senior Citizens and patients at Fortis and Apollo Hospitals just opposite to IIM? We are not sure whether the noise gets stopped or not.

Today morning I have discovered that all my shoes and few pairs of my wife's are gone :( . This is third incident and I am sure there are stolen. After every incident we will be extra cautious for few months and then when we lower our guards it happens, Sad. It some how shake us and make us think how these people ( who has done the picking ) can be so audacious about law and order. If they can do it with shoes today they can plan anything tomorrow.

Respected BCP, what actions taken on Sub Inspector Naveen for assaulting and humiliating NRI and Celebrate of Kannada film Industry CHETHAN inside Police station of Cubbon Park limits when he came to lodge an FIR..? 
A warm hello to the Bangalore Police team. :)
The reason why I use the word "warm" in my greeting is that I saw something today that warmed my heart. During office hours, I usually step out for a cup of coffee at a Darshini located close to the office. Almost everyday, policemen walk into this hotel and walk out without paying after eating their snacks and beverages. Today, when I saw the two policemen in the photograph below enter the darshini, I expected them to do the same. However, they surprised me by paying for their snacks and coffee and went about their work with minimum fuss. When I said that I wanted to click their picture and write about them, they said, and I quote the person who is at the driving wheel, "We are normal citizens like you, Sir. All we did was pay for our cup of coffee." This sentence touched me because till now I have assumed that all the cops in Bangalore are corrupt. But, now I am a fan of these two who respect the basic rights of the general public. Bangalore is lucky to have cops like this in the system. 
Is it illegal to walk on the streets at night?

Dear Sir/ Madame, 

Request you to kindly note the total absence of zebra crossing for pedestrians at many major traffic junctions around Bangalore, more specifically at ::
[1] Tumkur Road-Goreguntepalya Traffic junction 
[2] Tumkur Road-RMC Yard Traffic Junction 
[3] Tumkur Road-ORR Junction
[4] Tumkur Road-Yeshwanthpur Railway Station Junction

... this is cause for major worry and risk to life and limbs for hundreds of commuters crossing these roads. People are often stranded in the middle of the road often in the face of high speed traffic, both two wheelers and four wheelers, almost getting run down.

Please address this situation immediately. Regards. 
Hit by Veh No: KA03AB3644 while cycling back from office to home at arnd 18:40 PM nr More megastore Marathalli. The driver of the vehicle was getting on to the ring road towards KR Puram from the road between Marathahalli water treatment plant and More Megastore crossing the service road without stopping. Apart from breaking a traffic rule the driver abused me for not stopping for his vehicle which was speeding to cross the junction. Request BTP to take action.

@CCBBangalore again raided 2 Fake Job Exp Certificate issuing firms. Charged 25-30K to create fake work-exp history. 
I had a very interesting situation yesterday.  I was in Jayanagar, when an officer of Traffic police, stopped me, after he checked my car number on his mobile. He told me of three  traffic violations and I need to pay the fine.  I promised to him that I will clear it next day ( which I will be doing so today ) as I had no enough amount to pay cash. He was kind and  very well behaved. Thanks a lot.

One of the violation is supposed to be not wearing seat belt.  As per the Supreme court order, - as published by local papers - the seat belt has been made mandatory ( under law ) only in 4 metros - Mumbai/ Chennai/Delhi/Kolkotta.  If that being the case, is it right to punish by fine
in Bangalore yet?  Also, once Bangalore police decides to implement it, then should not they give say 30 days time - making people to stop and wear it with warning that there will be no leniancy after that period? 

Again, in my humble view, in city where the speed is hardly 30 to 40 km except in a few stretches ( may be airport road after yelahanka or parts of outer ring road etc ) does it matter much?  On the other hand, on highways to Mysore, Chennai, Hyderabad etc, seat belt should be mandatory because of the high speed driving?

Also, heard that senior citizen has been exempted .  Is this true?

Finally, is there a web site which can inform us pending traffic violations
so that we can regularly check and clear - instead of getting into situations like the above?

Thanks you Bangalore Traffic Police Officers and Commissioner.

 We'd like to thank Traffic Police Constable Vijay H.S in responding to a senior citizen's need near Narayanpura cross (hegde nagar/thannisandra) early this morning. 
Background: We found an old man near the signal, lying on the footpath and covered in blood with deep lacerations on his head (he apparently spent the night on the footpath after being injured in a fight). The old man was conscious but severely injured . We brought this to the attention of Vijay, who was busy managing a very congested signal. He helped us locate the old man's family and call them to provide the medical attention.  The beauty of the whole thing is that Vijay managed the traffic single handedly at the peak traffic hour and at the same time coordinated with us and his family to bring help. Vijay was very polite and empathized with the situation.  Please pass on a pat-on-his back for being what police should truly be - empathetic and concerned about the welfare of citizens.
 
Dear sir,

Good morning.

I would like to highlight the snapshot of the post which is becoming popular..

The snapshot is regarding some people from Cow protection group have burned a vehicle in this regard and they are giving suggestions for all who support the cause to remove number plates..

Erase chassis number of vehicles they burn so that there cannot be any legal process or insurance claim for the vehicle transporting cows.

I do support saving cows but not violence or wish any one to promote this.

I have already highlighted this with Facebook team.

Request you to action on this as there is a huge fan base in Karnataka also for cow protection cause.

Yours Faithfully,

Dear Sir,

I work in an MNC in Bangalore. I had an accident today [28th Jan] afternoon 1:30pm near Marathalli. People on the other side were behaving badly after the accident, though it was their fault. I called 100 number 7 times between 2:00pm to 2:30pm it was NEVER picked. Then I had to compromise and settle the issue with other party. I am lucky that it was a small issue which I could resolve on my own. I am afraid if it would have been a big crime, what would have happened.   

I am not sure how seriously the operations for this helpline [100] are handled. I am sure next time if I need any help I would NEVER call Police.

Thanks,
Anil

Hii

I received miss call from this no 9982266764. When I call back to this no the guy who replied saying that he got 4 kg gold and wanna sell it for lesser price. He said that he is from Rajasthan. And when I said I will complaint to police he said its appreciated if given complaint it will nothing do to him he said. He started asking my friends no too to refer them to buy a gold from him. Seems like a big fraud he is. Kindly see n to it. 
sir any body is looking for printer service or toner refilling in any of u r station can call us 
Some people are collecting Rs.20 for parking on Dr B R Ambedkar Road, behind Vidhana Soudha.  This started a week ago.  First a man came around and demanded the parking fee.  When asked for the receipt he walked away.  Now he has printed yellow parking ticket tokens and is terrorising the students of CMS Jain College who park there.  Please let me know if this is a legal parking fee or is it just some thugs who are making a quick buck. 
Dear Sir,
There are 2 things in my mind which I need to discuss
1. Traffic rules and road discipline
2. Rowdyism 
Traffic rules and road discipline
I really dont know why people are the most in-disciplined and arrogant on roads, but Road discipline is a must due to the growing number of vehicles. We have to take complete control on road lane discipline. Sir, till now Lane discipline is never seen. School bus drivers, cab drivers and auto riksha  drivers are the biggest culprits infact and others do not follow lane discipline.
  
Sir, please make a strict rules for each and everyone they must & should follow Lane discipline. 
1. Traffics, whatever it may be, Lane discipline is must and should. While changing from one lane to another make sure that there is no vehicle behind and right or left indicator is must turn on before changing the lane. 
2. If some vehicle is changing the lane and given indication, Slow down and Give way to the vehicle.
3.  All roads to be well-marked with arrows.
4.   Navigation to be improved in google maps, all signs, Road marks, and clear arrows to be include in navigation.

 We should also focus on changing habits through laws and public campaigning. Definitely we will make these changes to avoid accidents.

Rowdyism
Everywhere!!! It is.  Now a days Bangalore has become a worst places to live in. Roadside rowdyism like brawls and eve-teasing owing to irresponsible drinking habits etc Were totally sick and tired of unruly behavior, casual fights and brawls that makes whole city unsafe.
There are more than 10 incidents I have seen till now, On a road small accidents happens, calling other friends (rowdies) and threatening to man-handle drivers and use abusive languages,really ridiculous.  
Situations whatever it may beshouting, Using abusive words and Man-handle to be prohibited strictly on road. 
Why there is no proper law for the above 
Day by day threatening is also increasing. Till now NOBODY issued any statement about this matter and violations in general.
Prohibit
Prohibit Incitement and provocation of arguments, quarrels, swearing, hitting and so forth.
 Physical manhandling of other person should take severe disciplinary action.

I hope our city will be free from Violence

Dear Friends

Political Interference in Police transfers and Postings is rampant in Siddaramiah's Government. I have 40 minutes(recommendary letters) given by Siddaramiah for Transfer of Police Officers. Infact it has become a business for the party leaders and functionaries to have their choice of officers for committing offences in their respective areas and get rid of prosecution with the help of thus transferred POLICE OFFICERS.

 If siddaramiah challenges on this I have no hesitation in submitting these documents before the governor of Karnataka seeking for prosecution of Siddaramiah. 
It would be gud if the public could rate police inspectors and stations according to the service they provide.This could help the force to improve as well as boost their morale

I have given complaint on my last mobile phone in Kalisiplaya police station. They did not file any FIR but they given some receipt in that there is no number nothing only seal with signature. How can I know whether  they are tracking my mobile phone using IMEI number. Please help me on this , I have some sentiment with my last mobile phone. 
We'd like to thank Traffic Police Constable Vijay H.S in responding to a senior citizen's need near Narayanpura cross (hegde nagar/thannisandra) early this morning. 
Background: We found an old man near the signal, lying on the footpath and covered in blood with deep lacerations on his head (he apparently spent the night on the footpath after being injured in a fight). The old man was conscious but severely injured . We brought this to the attention of Vijay, who was busy managing a very congested signal. He helped us locate the old man's family and call them to provide the medical attention.  The beauty of the whole thing is that Vijay managed the traffic single handedly at the peak traffic hour and at the same time coordinated with us and his family to bring help. Vijay was very polite and empathized with the situation.  Please pass on a pat-on-his back for being what police should truly be - empathetic and concerned about the welfare of citizens.

Please ask all the police focal's to behave decently to the public who reaches them for any help..  All over they are public servants and they earn money when we pay our taxes. Most of the Police focals (may be SI, ASI or constables) they use abusive language towards the common man... I have seen SI and Constables taking money from the road side shops are they so poor that they beg.. I feel beggers are better than these ppl. 
Fact or fraud,  take a good look at the groom, who fell in love with a  US girl  who was  actually a online customer's daughter  they were good frnds for about 2/3yrs then  when he proposed  he had nothing, other than a basic job in india so the girl decides,  that they 1st make the basic imp arrangements like housing, yupp here is where she gave the beggar some status& respect in society  things go smooth for the next two yrs  they are in the brim of  getting married, Then a tragedy strikes  the girl  has to leave  US brfly
 she disappears from his romantic radaar too  the guy who went around saying he  loved and respected her more than his own life had no patience to wait for her to get back he traces her and brks up hahahaha the end of  millionth love story of rich & poor  cannot not have life together  if you accept this as a fact of life now  for the fraudulent part, she had lent him a huge sum of money  do you think as any  respectable human being he must have either paid her back  hahahah noppe he dint, he went ahead and got married to another girl from the money and and the status of his ex gf the worst inhuman thing he did was that when she was in trouble she did not ask for the money but for a legal documentation  of the whole transaction in the form of a blank chq  can any one guess what the desi Scoundrel had to say he told her give me the amount in cash and take the  house i shall not give you a blank chq !!!! hahahhaha  i read shariq's post about husband leaving his wife this is a  true incident happened to one of my good frnd   i too am only wondering how does this guy sleep with another gal on the cot he made for his love of life ????? does any one  knw a good police 1st then a lawyer its not about that i want to fight for her money back its about teaching this rascal a lesson of life that he does not have ryt to brk some ones dreams and built hisown  on a pot of luck and fraudulent  lies  like this  if any of you agree on this pleassssssss let me knw how u can help me get to him

BCP also used the Mobile CCTV & integrated Communication Command vehicle! It can be taken anywhere in Karnataka 
Cigarette selling near schools are prohibited. Near K V V School , Subbana Garden, it is just the opposite, you can find people in large numbers assembled, since there is a car wash behind it, but majority are smokers, and they park their vehicles hapazordly and are rude.  They are ready for physical attack, citing as if they are the area Rowdies.  WE have been requesting this on Facebook since many months but no results as of now.  There is no Cheetah vehicle on Rounds and recently there had been an attempted robbery in our area.  Students park their vehicle in the middle of the Road and expect drivers to steer past their vehicles without touching their vehicle.  Request the right authorities to take action regarding the same. 
We have been writing about the below in Facebook since 3 to 4 months but there has been no response from your end. People gathering near to K V V School , Subbana Garden, 1st Main Road, for smoke, park their vehicles hapazordly , there is never a Cheetah Beat and vehicles are parked on the main road creating problem for the traffic, the boys who park their vehicles are ready for physical duel, since they think they are big rowdies, if these people are not handled now at an early stage, more hazzles would start in the area.  Actually selling of Cigarettes are prohibited near Schools but no Police personnel have stopped the selling of the Cigarettes 
The Multi Level Parking in Majestic is one of the hazardous place and a territory for illegal activities, There are many vehicles which are parked probably months together and not even moved, may be those are stolen vehicles ? There is no security and going inside and probably would be a great hideout for the bad guys..... 
Car Lying unclaimed for one year on the road, behind two roads of Maruthi Medicals, R P C Layout, near TTMC Vijayanagar, can be reached through Coffee Day 5th main R P C Layout, Previously also had posted on Facebook, but no action taken till date. 
I have been seeing lot of improvement in the URBAN police especially in Bangalore only and most of police officer behave very professionally but believe me there is dark side of police in the RURAL area where policeman is no difference then thug ... even DSP like cadre will submit fake report in their investigation and SP will conclude it. Even RURAL policeman they don't know how to respect senior citizen or woman.....when you take the case with SP or IG it wont make difference ... Here in URBAN area there is awareness and URBAN police have to engage and listen... that's the big difference . NOW the Q is can Karnataka Police improve Rural areas example bijapur district same as Bangalore.... 
Hello Sir, in shikaripalaya near Electronics City there is lot of Noise from Mosque Loudspeaker. We live around a km away, still can hear these sounds. Request you to ensure noise level within permissible legal limits

Sir how should we deal with stupid and irresponsible BMTC bus conductors... let me share latest incident.. i board the the bus from Domlur to Murugeshpalaya, Conductor took 20 rupees and didn't give me ticket and when i asked for ticket he said give me 4 rupees more then i gave him 10 rupees. Now without reason he raised his voice and asked me to give change.. i was not carrying change hence asked him to assist me. He stopped the bus and asked me to leave .... i left the bus . The question is when he took 20 rupees and dint give me ticket then it is RIGHT (as per him) and when i asked ticket he got angry and thrown me out of bus.. the bus is not owned by conductor or individual... i was angry but dont want to get in fight with him hence need complaint cell number so that in future such conductors must be punished since they are cheating people and government both. Please share complaint procedure details... (i dont remember the bus number or conductor face but in future will use the appropriate processes.)

 Dear Dayanand Sir,
As the city is developing but the infrastructure is not enough for the growing population, leading to road mishaps. According to information from your facebook page, a total of 729 persons had lost their lives in road accidents at Bengaluru last year. 

Every individual needs to understand the concept of the safety rules and abide by the traffic rules. Thus creating awareness among people on traffic rules is essential to minimize the number of road accidents. 

Traffic Awareness campaign initiated by volunteers of  Volunteer for a Cause (VFC), a city based voluntary organization, serves as a reminder to everyone not to ignore the traffic rules. VFC volunteers create Traffic Awareness through banners and posters, at different locations across Bangalore on a monthly basis.

When the signal turns red, the volunteers holding various placards with signs and information on Traffic Rules stand in front of the motor vehicle users till the signal time comes to an end and when the signal turns green, they move sideways making way for vehicles to pass. 

The awareness is created to different people who pass through the chosen junction in the duration of two hours that volunteers spend at all the signal points in that junction.

Thanks to Bengaluru Traffic Police of Chalukya Signal for being Cooperative during our Campaign :-) 

Next month we would conduct the campaign at Corporation circle, We'd request your permission for the same.

Respected Sir I would like to Bring to your Notice that I got a SMS claiming won 3.35crore please take the necessary action against this. I've Attached a screenshot for your notice. 
Dear Bangalore City Police,

I have been receiving fake calls originating from Serbia,number starting from +381XXXX, in my case the number is +381616575760.

These calls arrive at night or early in the morning and would ring only once or twice, ensuring the call is missed. Being off guard at such odd times, you may end up calling back.

Bit of Google search gave the below results:

This is scam Premium Rate number (00381)from Serbia. You will get charged at a premium call rate, if you call back and the scammers would get a portion of it. You will be kept on hold, while they play music or even run erotic audio tapes in an effort to keep you hooked. The longer they manage to keep a victim on the call, the higher they make.

Can we do anything to prevent this ?

Thank you.

Dear Bangalore city police - we would like you to shed more light on the recent crackdown on smoking in public cases being taken up by your respective stations. We would really like to know what places are designated as public by the police as cases of abusive behaviour are reported even when people are found smoking in an empty street or areas that are at a safe distance from public gathering. 

I have read the cotpa rule book which is incomprehensive and when asked for an explanation, we are asked to file a case in court and challenge the same. Please help the public on what is right and what isn't. Thanks in anticipation.

 E-mail sent by Sri. Sandeep Jakati to Sri. B.Dayananda, IPS, Addl. CP, Traffic, Bengaluru City.
Respected Dayanand Sir,
This is to bring to your Kind Notice that kind of Professionalism showed by Mr. Manjunath H. Traffic Police Constable Attached to Jalahalli Traffic Police station, Bangalore. Myself and my Dad Aged 68 Years visited Jalahalli Traffic Police station last Saturday for Violation related issue, Manjunath greeted us and offered us Chairs and even asked if we would drink water being an Sunny day, He listened to our issues patiently for nearly 20 to 30 minutes and helped us in getting the issues Resolved, The kind of commitment, very decent and Professional behavior towards us was very people friendly, I had second thoughts visiting police station thinking I would get an no care attitude by Policemen, But Manjunath has set an very good Example by letting me know that Traffic police are also very humble, professional and have an very friendly approach towards Public.

I would sincerely like to appreciate his behavior and treating public in a very good manner, Please appreciate his good work and I assume this good behavior of Manjunath H would set example to other Traffic Constable in the city, I Would also highlight such work would make him grow higher in the Department. Please convey my Thanks and Appreciation to Manjunath H from my side and also from my Dad.

Thanks Mr. Manjunath.

Good Morning to all BTP Friends. Always Follow Traffic Rules
I would like to appreciate the hard word done by police across the bangalore... 

But I would also like to let you know that. There are many more work to be done.. Stopping ganja dealer n buyer across the bangalore, it's very sad to know that new generation is getting more addited to theses drugs. Even school kids who are in 10th r skin weed and harmful drugs.. In other side is killing the youth n that's not at all good for everyone..  I would like to highlight many more things but I feel some what that there are many cops who catchs dealers n collect the Bribe n leaving them again..  Mostly innocent people get caught rather investing n catching the many culprit you just punish the person who was working for them.. 

Yes you would be try to catch hold of these people but having no evidence you can't put them behind the bars...  

Please give the preferences to people n youth who r really interested to support directly or indirectly to bangalore city police... 

I hope you will think about it and work on it..  Changes can be done n made by your efforts..  

Thanks you.. 
A new trend of theft has started in the area around BTM and it is as scary as it sounds. Some one has been breaking into houses in the morning between 7-8am and walking away with laptops n mobiles n any other valuables around from houses with people in the house. And I have met people who have faced this on 3 consecutive days. 
The person doing this breaks in to the house, sedates people inside and walks away with his bounty. 
People around BTM beware of such incidents because if a person is capable of walking close to you to sedate you can take the next step if required. 
Already filed an FIR for this incident on Wednesday at my place. 
Hi.
Please consider this as a complaint against an auto driver who's auto number is "Ka 03 aa 7116". My wife hired this auto from GM Palya today in afternoon. He started with meter and just after half km, he wanted to deviate towards longer route. When asked to go by shorter route he demanded extra money. When confronted he started arguing and shouting and tookthe auto to auto stand where he started talking to other auto drivers. My wife confronted and asked for his name and wrote down the auto number. His license and name was not on the auto. She got off the auto saying she doesn't want to travel. When he saw her writing the number. He came to her and misbehaved and tried to snatch her phone. Fonally she gave him mo.ey for half km and then also he was stalking her till she got another auto. We are feeling insecure that he can come back and create problems for us.

Please take the necessary action against this driver.

Sir,

I had been following up the posts in this page and feel you are doing a really good job. This post is to bring to your notice that the traffic in Bangalore is really pathetic. Hardly 5% of the commuters are following the traffic rules. Reaching home safe every day after work has become an achievement for people in Bangalore. Today an auto rickshaw drove over my leg while standing in a signal.The reg number of the auto is KA 01 AD 7738. Why should the innocent public be victims of such erratic drivers? Please tighten the traffic rules and take corrective actions before the traffic situation turns out of control.

In many cities in India, there is far better decorum.They have achieved this just by strict enforcement of traffic rules.

Dear sir, There are two handles for DCP east, one is @DCPEASTDIVISION & @dcpeastbcp. Which one is the correct one? 
Two guys on a bike (KA 01 ev 7629) tried to snatch my cell phone in kormangala 17th f main, KHB colony, 5th block, just half an hour back near mediplus shop. I was lucky enough that i was holding it tightly so they couldn't take it away. Three days back also a guy snatched one lady's cell phone and police had come. Such incidents have made it unsafe area for people. Request you to take immediate action. 
To Bangalore police,

I am constrained to draw your kind attention to the growing activities of thieves in my locality btm layout (near water tank area)

recently there are three incident of theft which have occured in my localty in  three consucativie days.Today somebody broke into my house and stolen two  laptops and a mobile phone.I would like to draw attention of people of this area.plzzzz keep precaution toward  it,,hope soon bangalore police will resolve this issuue..waiting for favourable response.I have already lodged a police complaint in mico layout police station. 
Dear Sir, 

we have been receiving complaints by some of the lady employees in Global Village Tech Park behind R.V.Engineering College about some stranger coming to them while waiting in the bus stops asking directions for a particular place and when told, asking them if they wanted drop to go somewhere  and try to shake hands with the ladies, This incident is been repeated near BGS hospital & Uttarahalli road. we request you to take necessary action for women's safety. Some of the complaint which we have received are given below.

On 1st September, 2014 when one of our lady employees was on her way home in the evening, a man in a red colored Maruti Swift stopped her and asked her for directions to Banashankari/electronic city. She gave him the directions and he further asked if she is heading the same way can she accompany him. She declined and by then her bus reached and she boarded the bus. This happened outside the back gate of GV campus near the BGS hospital bus stop. After a few stops, the employee saw the same car approach another woman on the road but in the opposite direction  possibly trying the same tactic.
         Almost a similar incident happened on 10th September 2014 with another of our employees at the same spot. But this time he went a step further and tried to shake hands with her after asking for directions to Banashankari. The employee managed to cross the road and board the bus she wanted to get on to.
         This morning (12th September) at the same spot, the same man was spotted on a 2-wheeler loitering around aimlessly. He saw our employee and tried to flirt with her and she avoided him and made it to the office.
The modus operandi seems to be common  come in a red car and ask lonely women for directions and in the process take advantage of the situation.
We can say that these two employees have been lucky to not have been harmed but we cannot rely on luck forever. We have distributed pepper spray bottles to all our lady employees as a precautionary measure and frequently engage them in activities so that they stay alert.
Given this background, we would definitely want to alert people about this and also discuss what additional steps could be taken to prevent any incidents.

Hi Team,
I would like to inform that I also faced similar situation as explained in the below mail.

I was asked for the directions to Banashankari/electronic city by a man in Activa which had Hp(not mphasis) parking symbol it around 6:20Pm on 21st January 2015 at BGS bus stop. He tried to Shake hands introducing himself that he is so and so from HCL. I gave him the directions and he further asked if I am heading the same way  he can drop me. However I denied his offer and stood away waiting for my bus.
But I continued to observe what he was trying to do, I saw him approaching one more girl and asking for the directions. She too showed him way and denied to accompany him. Then, he left the place, Meanwhile I got my bus. I saw him again one stop ahead talking to one more Girl.
Here are some suggestions from my end.
(1)Please circulate the awareness mail to each and every one.
(2)Inform the police for more patrolling in this route and if they can keep close eye for any such incidents in future and catch hold of such guys ensuring female security.
(3)Last but not the least please take necessary actions from your end for safety of your employees. (Street lights,  Arranging security guys......)
Please take necessary actions at the earliest to ensure employees safety.
Thanks,

Sir, 

The traffic violation by BMTC buses in Bangalore is going really bad. They hardly adhere to signals. The Banashankari bus stand situation has gone really bad due to erratic drivers of BMTC. Kindly take some corrective steps

After a few stops, the employee saw the same car approach another woman on the road but in the opposite direction  possibly trying the same tactic.
         Almost a similar incident happened on 10th September 2014 with another of our employees at the same spot. But this time he went a step further and tried to shake hands with her after asking for directions to Banashankari. The employee managed to cross the road and board the bus she wanted to get on to.
         This morning (12th September) at the same spot, the same man was spotted on a 2-wheeler loitering around aimlessly. He saw our employee and tried to flirt with her and she avoided him and made it to the office.
The modus operandi seems to be common  come in a red car and ask lonely women for directions and in the process take advantage of the situation.
We can say that these two employees have been lucky to not have been harmed but we cannot rely on luck forever. We have distributed pepper spray bottles to all our lady employees as a precautionary measure and frequently engage them in activities so that they stay alert.
Given this background, we would definitely want to alert people about this and also discuss what additional steps could be taken to prevent any incidents.

Hi Team,
I would like to inform that I also faced similar situation as explained in the below mail.

I was asked for the directions to Banashankari/electronic city by a man in Activa which had Hp(not mphasis) parking symbol it around 6:20Pm on 21st January 2015 at BGS bus stop. He tried to Shake hands introducing himself that he is so and so from HCL. I gave him the directions and he further asked if I am heading the same way  he can drop me. However I denied his offer and stood away waiting for my bus.
But I continued to observe what he was trying to do, I saw him approaching one more girl and asking for the directions. She too showed him way and denied to accompany him. Then, he left the place, Meanwhile I got my bus. I saw him again one stop ahead talking to one more Girl.
Here are some suggestions from my end.
(1)Please circulate the awareness mail to each and every one.
(2)Inform the police for more patrolling in this route and if they can keep close eye for any such incidents in future and catch hold of such guys ensuring female security.
(3)Last but not the least please take necessary actions from your end for safety of your employees. (Street lights,  Arranging security guys......)
Please take necessary actions at the earliest to ensure employees safety.
Thanks,

I also appeal to the higher officials to expedite investigations in FIR 40/2014 filed at Police Station Seshadripuram Bangalore where the accused have tampered Government documents to cover up the death of an innocent patient. 
JP Nagar Police Station Bangalore has not registered a charge sheet in FIR 450/2010 even after four and a half years notwithstanding directives from National Human Rights Commission and National Commission for Women even when both Karnataka Medical Council and Medical Council of India has indicted one of the accused - Dr Ramcharan Thiagarajan of Fortis Hospital and cancelled his registration for a period of one year and Karnataka High Court dismissed the writ petition (WP 12668/2014) filed by Fortis Hospital challenging the cancellation of their organ transplant license by Government of Karnataka? What are the reasons whereby the guardians of law are unable to complete investigations in four and a half years? 

I request the higher officials to intervene in the interests of equity and justice. Please be guided by the judgment pronounced by Supreme Court of India dated 20.01.2015. The attached link refers.

Hi Police Commissioner ,

Complaints on the   Bangalore Trafiic Police Facebook page are not being acted upon or atleast inform people this facebook page , that they cannot complain about any issues here.

I had complained in this page 4 times since last 6 months  about Vehicles driving in wrong way in Post Office Road in KR Circle and still nothing is done . 

few days back, 2 cars would have almost collided head on .  I am not able able understand how can bangalore traffic police be so negligent about vehicles driving wrong way in the heart of the city .

Is the complaint system so bad the trafiic police facebook complaints cannot be forwaded to seniors police officers if repeated complaints are being made . 
If so then its better to shutdown this page or inform public this page is used only for BTP to post info and public cannot post there complaints/issues here 

Thanks 
Today I received a call from this number 9599257354 and told that the call is from VISA. The person talking,was speaking to me in Hindi. I was told that a fraudulent activity has happened in my card (couldn't say which card) and an amount of 8999 has been debited. The I was asked if I have my credit card with me and asked me the credit card details so that they can credit the amount back to my account. Clearly, it is a fake call to dupe people. People should be made aware of such calls. 
sir something has to be done they are getting bolder by the day 
A near miss fatal accident at the traffic signal at Outer ring road -  KalyanNagar-Kammanhalli junction today is the reason why I am writing this post today.A vehicle which stopped and purposefully trying to jump the red signal almost hit the pedestrians crossing the road. The Skywalk is still under construction and pedestrians have to cross when the signal is red (which is set to a high duration). Most of the vehicles speed up at that signal (despite the signal being red) causing road crossing extremely hazardous and accident prone to pedestrians.Everyday I see school children/college student crossing this road huddled together & afraid, and  I request all Bangalore citizens who drive the vehicle to give way to pedestrians and also request the police in the location to strictly enforce traffic rules at that signal. 
As we all are aware of, it is as per law that dogs cannot be prohibited from public areas if they are leashed and is not dirtying the place (which is ironic cos what they pass out is organic and what we humans throw around are non biodegradable). Anyway, today morning, my babies Goldie and Lily along with their new friend Betty and her mommy were taking a walk. They stepped on an open land and a man (who is not even an owner) asked us very rudely to leave the area. We didn't react much but even when we were on the footpath adjacent to the land, he kept shouting at us asking us to leave. All of this in kannada and I did not understand a word. I politely asked him to talk in English so that i understand to which he said "Get lost". Betty's mommy who knew kannada conversed with him and later told me that he was abusing us and the dogs and taunting the fact that we had money to "waste" on dogs, etc. 
That's not the end. On my way to office, I have to cross that area and the man, this time along with two other well built goon looking men came up to me and were as usual trying to tell me something in kannada. Sounded like some threat. I politely walked off cos I was alone.
Can anyone connect me to a cop regarding this illegal harassment? Or even better have any better idea?

Good Morning to all BTP Friends. Don't use mobile phone while driving/riding.
How do you plan to handle the case of suicide, of the young student from a leading school in Bangalore? I would like to know if the school is going to be investigated. 
One thing NPS HSR LAY OUT school,Bangalore, is hiding the true facts of the murder or suicide case of the Odia girl whom the principal of the school gave a suspension letter from the school, which is the cause of her destruction. They have given wrong information to the medias,in times of India about the bad character of the girl, one immoral and defamation, one child abuse, some points I want to clarify what is the moral conduct, or code of conduct of the school. it depends on the rules, the school forms. NPS ,BANGALORE allow the grown up students to sit together in the class room together. they believe in the mingling of students in co-education. they give importance to the free education. Therefore students have been used to mingle freely with each other. Another point is dress code. code of conduct of the dress, they like to see girls wearing small skirts exposing their legs. They appreciate and encourage such dress code. Suddenly they abuse or defame a girl for her free talking with a boy as an immoral way of code of conduct is really ridiculous and funny judgement.

NPS,Bangalore has been affiliated to the government ,central board secondary education which must follow all the rules and regulations of the educational policy. Here they have violated all by punishing the girl so badly by giving her a suspension letter. They have mentally harassed the student, There cannot be any sort of harassment ,physical or mental by school management or authority. The principal has no right to give suspension letter. It is the duty of the management to discuss personally the matter with parents. They have mentally tortured the girl. They have abused and defames the girl. They have accused the girl as doing physical sex or immoral conduct where they have no evidence. The school management is the cause of her death. Suicide is the mental state of her harassment, trauma and frustration. It is purely a child abuse, a defamation and criminal case.Even the government school is collecting lakhs of money as donation in the name of minority development, development of minority community and religion. Very strict action should be taken against the management and the principal. so that in future no student will be threatened , harassed and abused by the NPS school. I would like to request all Bangalore based Odia samaj and medias to conduct meeting a discussion against child abuse or harassment to Odia girl which is deprived of her right, child's right from the school, laws and society.we can conduct one literary meet on this occasion also ,one condolence meet for the salvation of her soul.

And was beaten till he was bleeding profusely and he had to run for his safety from that psycho and luckily he was helped by some bikers who took him to the hospital 
He had 4 stitches and was kept under observation for a day in the ICU and he filed an FIR and also had to pay 900 rupees and not even a single cop came to the hospital nor was this issue taken seriously 
kindly enquire more about this and please take things more seriously and do some serious work when such a thing happens.. 2 more blows with that stone on the head he could have died 
at least please respect people's life and we expect some action and some work towards such things and bring such things into light !!!

Dear BCP...firstly I would like to thank you for the wonderful and swift action taken in crime prevention. I however have a small suggestion- Kindly request you to avoid revealing names of the accused as it reveals the caste or religion of the accused, which therefore leads to misunderstandings amongst the general public towards a particular religion or caste. As India is a very sensitive nation towards ethnicity and religion.I  hence request you to avoid revealing the names of accused or criminals. The same is also followed by other countries like UAE, UK and other countries. Please look into it.

I received a call from 9670175301 at 1:27 pm on 22nd Jan, from someone claiming to be from SBI card department. They said that I have some reward points that are going to expire and that they I can use them as credit in my card amounting to about 4900 rs. To do so he said he will transfer my call to the "concerned department" for verification. He simply put me on hold and within a second another guy came on the line and asked me my date of birth. When I refused to provide my date of birth as SBI never calls and asks for personally identifiable information, and said that I will report them to police, they started yelling and abusing me.

Youth think smoking is style statement. Join hands with us to educate our youth about -ve effect of smoking, drugs.. 
city police should do thoroughly investigation of the case,,, they should write help line no, child abuse phno in NPS school HSR LAY OUTas they have written so nicely on the wall notice board of other private schools.children  may need to protest them from harassment and abuses. 
one of the student of class10th from HSR LAY OUT ,NPS school committed suicide due to her bad performance ,what is the cause of her suicide, child abuse or any other matter, city police should thoroughly investigate the matter
it should come out in news paper first,, it is also a bad news for such a reputed heart surgeon one of the famous Odia doctor, we must condemn and console both as long as whole fact is not exposed,, or come to day light, it is the question of our prestige also,,,
love is not a crime or offense but teen age is very crucial children cannot differentiate between good or bad, it is only infatuation at this age, after exam she would be all right, see children need friends boys or girls at this age as they feel lonely, parents stay busy in their jobs, they also do so important jobs they cannot give time to children so, what will they do, they take interest in friends more as they get education, knowledge and find more curiosity in friends.

The most tragedy is, I personally cameaccross the parents that, school's principal gave a letter of suspension of the girl from school in abusing and blaming her personally as a bad character. How can he judge so seeing her outward conduct of mixing freely with a boy friend. this is really bad. who is he to blame so? the parents can file a case of misinterpretation, defamation and above all a criminal case. school is the cause of her death now. I think together OCA community and the PTA body parents association of the school can ask the principal whole explanation of the case. what her parents say, it is a case of defamation, insult false allegation and a criminal case of child abuse as the girl is a minor. code of conduct or moral values of any school never says to suspend a child without any evidence without proper investigation and thorough discussion with the parents. the principal has no authority to write such letter without discussing with the school management. school is the main cause of her suicide.

The management cannot escape so easily defending a reputed renowned Odia doctor or parents ,they accused their daughter as bad character or bad code of conduct. what does the character means in a school . free mingling of girls and boys is the culture curriculum of NPS School as far as I know. when I was protesting not to make my daughter sit with boys ,the management attacked me abusing that ,it is co-education school, our motto of the school is to make no gap, no difference among boys and girls, they give sex education as a part of course, girls wear miniskirt exposing full legs and body. when I protest they say me they want ultra modern fashion and culture. they perform dances ,disco, ballad ,bolly wood so freely ,I have the videos of the dances, when a girl talked freely with a boy they immediately started abusing her as characterless and suspended from school as her parents said us. it is very humiliating and tragedy. a great offense, defamation to whole Odia community also. If sir goes for a protest we must support him. I think it is too much, this is not the business of school to interfere in any family life. the child is minor. How can they abuse her in an immoral prospect she was confused when she was suspended she could not find any way of her board exam, she is a very good student, she could not tolerate the allegation, humiliation and the harsh punishment of the school. so she committed suicide just to escape from such situation. she was in terrific trauma, frustration and mental stress. it is a pure mental torture and harassment to the Odia girl.
Now the management will come out from their false disguise, fake culture and hypocrisy , the motto for the over all development of minority they give slogan. they take lakhs of money as donation, as beggars take and in the name of culture, morality and code of conduct they do all drama. they violate all rules of educational policy, no PTA BODY, if it is government affiliated directly to CBSE then why do they take lakhs of donation? they collect money in the name of building construction work, greedy management. they are the criminals in the eyes of laws and educational policy. now they are doing all criminal and offensive works of harassing , killing or murdering students without any reason. 
Hi Team, yesterday morning (21st Jan at 11:50 AM) I received a call from No +91 92 66 663653. The lady on call informed she s from service provider like - Visa or Master Card . 
She s from banking n need some details AZ confirmation about the credit card I am currently owning like - is it master card or Visa. Also, she informed that I need to collect from gifts or prize from them. Her voice sounded as if, she s reading written script n was bit harsh. I didn't share any details with her n disconnected call immediately. Hope some action will be taken against these people n public will be safe.

Dear Sir,

This is to request your kind attention to the recently created TRAFFIC CHAOS at Marathalli Junction on Old Airport Road.

About two to three weeks back, Bangalore Traffic Authorities have implemented traffic restrictions at Kundalahalli Junction and Marathalli Junction. While at Kundalahalli Junction, the new traffic restrictions eased out the vehicle movement to very good extent, the restriction introduced at Marathalli Ring Road Signal Junction has created Chaos and the traffic now moves at snail's pace towards HAL direction. Earlier, even during peak hours one could pass Marathalli Ring Road Junction towards HAL in about 3-5 minutes in car. Now, to cover the 900 meters distance from Spice Garden Stop to Tulsi Theatre Road Stop (near Brand Factory), it takes about 15 - 25 minutes in vehicle any time between 8AM to 10PM. There is always traffic piled up from the Railway Flyover up to Tulsi Theatre Road stop towards HAL including Sundays & from Tulsi Theatre Road junction to Borewell stop towards ITPL (few days this block  extends up to HAL Police Station). 

The REASON: - As part of the new restriction the U-Turn intersections for both directions were removed at Marathalli Ring Road junction. The U-Turn towards Kundalahalli was extensively used by vehicles coming from Kundalahalli side to go towards KR Puram by taking the U-Turn to the approach road at the bridge itself after taking the first U-Turn on the main road. Due to the removal of right turn now at Kundalahalli Junction and the removal of U-Turn at Marathalli Ring Road Junction, all vehicles coming from Varthur side bound for KR Puram side are forced to take U-Turn at the Tulsi Theatre Road Junction. This heavy rush of vehicle from Kundalahalli side along with vehicles coming from Bellandur side to go towards ITPL (Almost all call centre  cabs and many private cars do not use the U-Turn at ISRO on the Ring Road for going towards ITPL while coming from Bellandur  side, but they come on to the main road and take U-Turn at Tulsi Theatre Road junction for ITPL) is causing traffic block at the Tulsi Theatre Road Junction and BLOCKs the traffic going towards HAL, and causes vehicles to pile up right from Spice Garden Stop  after the Railway Flyover. What is pathetic is, the Traffic Authorities do not seem to have taken any note of this NEW CHAOS they have created,  but deployed traffic constables to monitor the U-Turn  at Tulsi Theatre Road junction. When the traffic constables are on their duty breaks, the situation even goes worse making the traffic stand still as vehicles coming from HAL side and vehicles trying to take U-Turn towards ITPL/KR Puram block the spot. 

The solution to this problem may be the immediate and permanent removal of the U-Turn at Tulsi Theatre Road Junction and permit only Right Turn towards the Nakundi Road (near Indian Oil Petrol Pump) for going towards KR Puram. Also, there should not be U-Turn permitted at the Marathalli Market Junction. Vehicles crossing Marathalli Ring Road junction to go towards KR Puram (while coming from Kundalahalli side) and ITPL (while coming from Bellandur side) must use the U-Turns provided on the Ring Road near Innovative Multiplex and ISRO respectively. The authorities must enforce this.

The new traffic restrictions implemented at Kundalahalli Junction and Marathalli Ring Road Junction have actually eased out traffic at Kundalahalli junction, but worsened it at Marathalli area. 

Adding to these woes, the main road (Old Airport Road) has been dug up on both sides from Marathalli Ring Road Junction up to the Indian Oil Petrol Pump for laying drainage pipes and the broken road is left without asphalting. This is causing lot of dust and driving difficulties especially to pedestrians and two wheeler users.

I am sure your good office will already have the knowledge of the above issue. Through this note, it is my humble request to your esteemed office to kindly look into this matter urgently.

Thanking you.

Hi!

I would like to bring to the notice of the police that fraudsters and cheaters are operating freely in the city with minimal fear of the law.
I would like suggestions on what options I can pursue for my situation due to one such fraudster.
I shifted to Bangalore in August, and along with three friends, I took up three rooms in the Paying Guest Accommodation,going by the name of Luxury Comforts, operated by one guy named Md. Rehan, at Kormangala, near Maharaja Signal.
We gave him a total deposit of 30000 rupees cash.
We started facing issues very soon. He used to come to the PG drunk and used to engage in obscene activities.
Soon after the land-owner, on whose land he had setup his PG, filed a case against him, and so he left the place immediately and moved to his relative's house.
We were left in a lurch. When we approached him saying that this is illegal and that he should refund us the deposit along with the remaining month's rent, he started abusing us and threatened to beat us up.
We recently traced his number to another PG in kormangala,and called him up. When we asked him to return the money, he told us that he won't return a single rupee back and told us to do whatever we can. He also said that we can approach the police if we want to, as,according to him, can be bought by him and that he knows many senior members in the Police fraternity.
We have the receipts with us.
I hope I shall get a prompt acknowledgement and help in this regard by the Bangalore Police.
Please suggest as to what options we can pursue.

Court has extended the Police custody of Aafaaque, Abdus Saboor, Riyas Syeedi & Saddam Hussain upto 3rd Feb, 2015 in IM Explosive Seizure case. 
As an observer, I must say, Bangalore Police - particularly traffic police - has been doing a great job - possibly the best in India. During Commnr Shankar Bidri's time, the Police took special care to see road humps that are unscientific be removed and any road hump need to have approval from police and it had to be laid professionally.  But it seems all that is forgotten and drivers come across road humps at most unexpected and unwanted locations.

Also, police has been taking extra care to see Ambulance moved freely 
and cleared the signals the moment they could hear the siren.  However, two or three instances in the last couple of days make me wonder if some of the police people at the intersections are not advised of this !  couple of days back at the Okhalipuram Jun, the police did not take action to clear the ambulance and the ambulance driver was going on and on using different sirens.  It could move only when the traffic signal became green
by normal roation.  A similar thing was noticed at the Malleswaram 18 th cross too yesterday.  

Wish the police not only change traffic signal to green to make movement of ambulance, it also need to educate the drivers who are infront of the ambulance to move to sides slowly so that ambulance gets space to move easily.  Generally speaking Bangalore traffic is more responsive to ambulance, now a days; but still we come across instances which warrant us to express our thoughts on this.

once again, appreciate the great work done by Bangalore Traffic Police in the very polluted atmosphere - polluted by the smoke and other poisonous particles in the air and also the sound decibels 
Lost phone can anyone please suggest me wat is the procedure.

I donot ask anyone to give comment on this matter as it is a very complicated case we cannot say anything without proper investigation. one thing students must learn to value life's. school should teach them moral education.parents should have patience, school should not think of only reputation, name and good performance, they are collecting a huge amount of money as donation that time they should think how to face bad situations also, I have observed some schools take students from rich families as well as talented students who can afford more money as donation. when student's performance is deteriorated they rusticate students from their schools, they only take good students seeing their performance which is not correct where as schools like chinnmmaya mission, chaittannya and narrayanni do make categorization among good and bad students, they give equal attention and importance for the over all development ,good performance of the students, they give extra coaching also. 
one of the student of class10th from HSR LAY OUT ,NPS school committed suicide due to her bad performance ,what is the cause of her suicide, child abuse or any other matter, city police should thoroughly investigate the matter.

Last sunday on 11th january 2015 at 7:30 am  thief stole 2 laptops 2 wallet and 1 bag from our house (Pritamwoods Apartments, near sobha lake view club house, green glan layout, Bellandur ) .

Same case happened on 7th jan at 8:00 am in a nearby apartment in Green Glan Layout (4 laptops and 2 wallets got stolen).

On the same day we(me and my roommates ) went to police station (HSR) and spend almost 5 - 6 hrs but they did not file FIR, saying the officer who is supposed to register FIR is not here and made all kind of excuses. Next day on 12th jan we spent 3 hours in police station with this cctv footage to get the FIR filed. 

it's been 8 days and even after having the cctv footage and we knowing the one suspect, police haven't taken any action. 
when  asking for reason they are saying that "we are only three people and there are other important case pending.
Is this what the police suppose to do when they have clear evidence clear face of the person who stole the things worth 3lac?????

This is the way the Police Operate and Claim Helping the Citizens ..... Adrian Brown (Mob 9620303357) 
 Senior police officers were punished by being made to stand for 'misinforming' CM on chain snatching and robbery statistics

In a meeting that lasted over two hours on Tuesday at Vidhana Soudha, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah caught Bengaluru police top brass on the wrong foot when they gave him a set of misleading statistics on chain snatching incidents and robberies reported in the city last year. The CM pulled out a set of statistics provided to him by the State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) which showed a higher number of chain snatchings and lesser number of arrests. There was a clear mismatch between the statistics prepared by the city police and the SCRB. 

The city police gave the CM statistics which indicated 440 cases of chain snatching and 426 cases of robberies. Siddaramaiah compared the figures with the SCRB-provided data, which he had with him; it indicated 530 chain snatching incidents and 540 robberies. Angered by the deflated crime statistics presented to him by the city police, the CM made the city's seven Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP)-rank officers stand close to an hour for the remaining part of the meeting. 

Dramatis personae in the meeting were Siddaramaiah, Additional Director General of Police (Crime) S Megharik, Police Commissioner M N Reddi, ADGP (Railways) R P Sharma, Home Minister K J George, Home Secretary S K Pattanayak, and Additional Commissioner of Police (Administration) B N S Reddy among others. Here is how the meeting unfolded. It is not an ad verbatim reproduction, but an essence of what transpired at the meeting: 
 Siddaramaiah: George, starting now, please review the performance of the city police every month. I will personally review their work in April. If things do not fall in place by then, the DCP in whose jurisdiction crime rate remains higher will be dealt with a suspension. 

The city police tries to defend by stating that number of chain snatchings have gone up because of the liberal case registration process initiated by them in the last few months. 

S Megharik: Sir, reported crimes have gone up in the city mainly because of the liberal case registration process. There was a 10% increase all over the state in chain snatching cases between September and December last year, whereas there was an 80% increase in chain snatching incidents reported in the city in the same period. 

Siddaramaiah: This is something abnormal and it has to be set right. Why is there such a huge mismatch? 

Megharik: The SCRB gets crime data the moment a case is registered in the form of an FIR, and the data is updated when the accused is arrested. 

Siddaramaiah: Reddi, can you to explain what is going wrong? Why are your numbers different? 

M N Reddi: We collated the data gathered from each division through the City Crime Records Bureau. 

R P Sharma: There is an increase in the cases because of lack of proper supervision. The DCPs and rank officers are not conducting police station inspections as mandated by the police manual. If seniors regularly inspect the police stations and file annual inspection reports, lower ranks will pull up their socks and act in tandem. 

CM agrees with Sharma's view. 

Reddi: The seniors have regularly inspected police stations and there is no lax on their part. We promise to further increase station inspection. 

B N S Reddy speaks for almost 15 minutes explaining where things are going wrong when it comes to chain snatchers and muggers. 

Reddy: Courts are granting bail to chain snatchers who have hardly spent less than a week in jail after their arrest. The courts are not at fault, police are at fault, because we do not properly prepare the remand application, stating that a certain accused was arrested earlier or was previously involved in several cases of chain snatching. We do not write about the previous history of the habitual chain snatchers. In the absence of this crucial data, the court takes a lenient view and grants bail. Our inspectors leave the task of preparing remand application to the lower-rung writer. The inspectors themselves should show interest and prepare this application. This will empower the judge with the complete information. No judge will grant bail to a habitual offender if a proper case is made out. 

Reddy: There is also no one to watch offenders who come out of jail. There is no proper policy on who should give surety for these people. If the conditions of surety are tightened, most of these fellows would not get bail. 

Reddy: We need to map the chain snatching areas and the timings during which the incidents take place. Our patrol policemen should be told to concentrate on these areas instead of loitering near restaurants and pubs. We then have to monitor their movement through GPS. 

Chief Minister is impressed with Reddy's acumen and his practical suggestions. Pattanayak and Kempaiah appreciate Reddy's proposals. 

Siddaramaiah: Reddi, please follow what your subordinate has said and see to it that all his suggestions are implemented. You are responsible for setting this right. The crime rate must come down within next three months. 

Reddi: Yes, Sir. 

 The meeting also took serious note of the increase in vehicle burning cases reported across the city. The city police statistics on the vehicle burning cases did not match the data from SCRB records. The city police had produced the statistics stating that around 80 cases registered IPC 435 and around 20 cases of fire accidents (FA). The SCRB statistics showed that around 100 cases were registered under IPC section 435 and around 80 cases of FA. 
Can any one trust OLA? they accepted a booking of a cab To and from Innovative on 18-1- 2015 and my daughter and niece went there in OLA Taxi ,, the morons did not send the taxi to come back and when my called, they said it is on the way,, but later refused to send it.. On speaking to the customer care , I am being informed that the Taxi was booked by the Application and there is some problem in that.. 7 30 pm and Girls are coming back in a local bus ... Shame on OLA.

@blrcitytraffic @dcptreastbcp @CPBlr #CommercialStreet bike parking a menace and Mr Murthy the cop on the towing vehicle uses non-parliamentary language and forcefully collects fine from people without being able to show clear evidence. Also the street does not have any clear marking for cross-road intersections and no-parking sign boards. On the contrary one such incident on sunday where a traffic police on the spot says it's ok to park at the same spot from where the towing vehicle tows away the bike. Am not being the lone victim, there are were 10 such people being victimized on   the same spot. Also the behavior from Mr. Murthy is so baffling and words used so non-parliamentary that it definitely changes perspective towards the #BTP

Dear Bangalore Police, Frequently people park at intersection of 5th Main and Udupi Hotel (Behind Leela Palace). This leads to poor visibility for vehicles coming from 5th Main to the main road. This is an intersection where minor accidents are common. Hope the authorities ensure no parking at intersection to prevent major accident. Also, the footpath is occupied by Udupi Hotel forcing people to walk on the road - HAL II Stage (Kodihalli) RWA

The CM pulled out a set of statistics provided to him by the State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) which showed a higher number of chain snatchings and lesser number of arrests. There was a clear mismatch between the statistics prepared by the city police and the SCRB. 

 The city police gave the CM statistics which indicated 440 cases of chain snatching and 426 cases of robberies. Siddaramaiah compared the figures with the SCRB-provided data, which he had with him; it indicated 530 chain snatching incidents and 540 robberies. Angered by the deflated crime statistics presented to him by the city police, the CM made the city's seven Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP)-rank officers stand close to an hour for the remaining part of the meeting. 

 Dramatis personae in the meeting were Siddaramaiah, Additional Director General of Police (Crime) S Megharik, Police Commissioner M N Reddi, ADGP (Railways) R P Sharma, Home Minister K J George, Home Secretary S K Pattanayak, and Additional Commissioner of Police (Administration) B N S Reddy among others. Here is how the meeting unfolded. It is not an ad verbatim reproduction, but an essence of what transpired at the meeting: 
Siddaramaiah: George, starting now, please review the performance of the city police every month. I will personally review their work in April. If things do not fall in place by then, the DCP in whose jurisdiction crime rate remains higher will be dealt with a suspension. 

The city police tries to defend by stating that number of chain snatchings have gone up because of the liberal case registration process initiated by them in the last few months. 

S Megharik: Sir, reported crimes have gone up in the city mainly because of the liberal case registration process. There was a 10% increase all over the state in chain snatching cases between September and December last year, whereas there was an 80% increase in chain snatching incidents reported in the city in the same period. 

Siddaramaiah: This is something abnormal and it has to be set right. Why is there such a huge mismatch? 

 Megharik: The SCRB gets crime data the moment a case is registered in the form of an FIR, and the data is updated when the accused is arrested. 

Siddaramaiah: Reddi, can you to explain what is going wrong? Why are your numbers different? 

M N Reddi: We collated the data gathered from each division through the City Crime Records Bureau. 

R P Sharma: There is an increase in the cases because of lack of proper supervision. The DCPs and rank officers are not conducting police station inspections as mandated by the police manual. If seniors regularly inspect the police stations and file annual inspection reports, lower ranks will pull up their socks and act in tandem. 

CM agrees with Sharma's view. 

Reddi: The seniors have regularly inspected police stations and there is no lax on their part. We promise to further increase station inspection. 

B N S Reddy speaks for almost 15 minutes explaining where things are going wrong when it comes to chain snatchers and muggers. 

Reddy: Courts are granting bail to chain snatchers who have hardly spent less than a week in jail after their arrest. The courts are not at fault, police are at fault, because we do not properly prepare the remand application, stating that a certain accused was arrested earlier or was previously involved in several cases of chain snatching. We do not write about the previous history of the habitual chain snatchers. In the absence of this crucial data, the court takes a lenient view and grants bail. Our inspectors leave the task of preparing remand application to the lower-rung writer. The inspectors themselves should show interest and prepare this application. This will empower the judge with the complete information. No judge will grant bail to a habitual offender if a proper case is made out. 

Reddy: There is also no one to watch offenders who come out of jail. There is no proper policy on who should give surety for these people. If the conditions of surety are tightened, most of these fellows would not get bail. 

Reddy: We need to map the chain snatching areas and the timings during which the incidents take place. Our patrol policemen should be told to concentrate on these areas instead of loitering near restaurants and pubs. We then have to monitor their movement through GPS. 

Chief Minister is impressed with Reddy's acumen and his practical suggestions. Pattanayak and Kempaiah appreciate Reddy's proposals. 

Siddaramaiah: Reddi, please follow what your subordinate has said and see to it that all his suggestions are implemented. You are responsible for setting this right. The crime rate must come down within next three months. 

Reddi: Yes, Sir. 

 The meeting also took serious note of the increase in vehicle burning cases reported across the city. The city police statistics on the vehicle burning cases did not match the data from SCRB records. The city police had produced the statistics stating that around 80 cases registered IPC 435 and around 20 cases of fire accidents (FA). The SCRB statistics showed that around 100 cases were registered under IPC section 435 and around 80 cases of FA.

 Respected Sir,
       To the complaint given by Mr.Rafiq Kumar Shafi , we  would kindly like to state and bring notice to  your kind perusal that I have personally rounding up the place regularly and booking the cases by myself and I have also  deputed /discussed it with our station officer's and  directed the concern Sector officer to check the violation and book the cases, so that person should not violate the traffic rules and by that the other road users do not get effected.
       Sir, I myself have checking the area mentioned above and booking case to the violators and this is also done by our officers. It has come to my notice that even though the cases are booked, there are many vehicles which move around committing violation. So I have asked the concern police officer to tow the vehicle which has violated the traffic rules to the Traffic Station so that they shall know the Pinch and in future they shall not do the same and this shall provide good environment to the local residence.
  Thanking You.

Sir
I'm writing this msg with lot of regrets and pain. 
Yesterday at 3.00 pm I had an unforgettable incident on mysore road flyover over kr market. I had  to stop my car as the car in front stoped. There was a white swift and a motorbike speeding behind me probably they were having a street race. As my car stoped the swift behind me also did break and the bike banged behind the swift car. I could see the bike guy was thrown away from the bike. Though my vehicle was neither touched the car on front or by the car behind, on humanitarian ground i stoped and got out to have a check on the guy fell down. Then 5 young boys came out of the car and started abusing me in dirty language claiming the accident happened as I stoped the car . Then only I understood both the car n bike people were of same gang. Most of them were drunk and started asking me money for the car and bike repair. I told them will call the police and if police says will do what ever settlement they wanted. When I said police they got further agressive and dragged me away from the cars and threatened that  need to pay them 10000 immediately otherwise will damage my car. By the time two more bikes of the same gang joined n the crowd became 8 to 10. I told them need to call my friend to get money n walked bit away from them and dialed 100. I explained the lady officer the incident and she assured will send some cops immediately. This call was made at 3:17 pm. They did wait for 15-20 mnts and asked me to check the wallet how much money in my wallet. When I felt they are going to to attack n rob me, I told them not do any mistake coz I have already informed the police and they will reach anytime. Then they got violent and started beeting the windows and mirrors of my car and two guys did beat me too. They immediately covered their numberplate of the car and put me inside my car and asked to run away from the place. They were also taking photos of my car and me. It was almost 30 mnts past I called the control room. My first priority was to escape from the place as i was already beaten and my right rear view mirror also was broken by them. I could see that they were frightened of police and wanted to see which route I take stright flyover or take the exit towards majestic.

I was in a shock and down the ramp I called up the control room again to check why no cops reached for my rescue. The officer did not have any clue and said sorry if the cops did not reach in time.

More than the culture less boys, now I feel bad on our police. I asked the control room officer also same thing that tomorrow if she is in trouble while not in uniform how will feel if the rescue doesn't happen in time. 

I was really proud of bangalore city police compare to other cities I have lived in but not very sure about it now.

Dear Officers, 
                         Today we were on the way back from our classes at jayanagar and by mistake we took a right turn from the signal. The traffic police were standing there and caught us. They told that there is no right turn from that signal and we had to pay the fine. We didn't have money to pay the fine for our two bikes and later called our friends and they helped with the money. At that same time two cars, a toyota innova and a honda city, did the same mistake. The police even caught them. That time a guy from honda city got out and told the officer that its an important person's car. KA 51 MC 1711 is the registration. After a small conversation with the officer, the officer gave a green signal to them. My question is, Do we have separate rules for different people? It doen't matter who is the person, rules are rules and its meant to be followed by everyone. why is such kind of corruption and advantage taking control of our system? We ended up paying the fine and he just drove free. The youths here are following the traffic rules and regulations and co-operate with the officers if we break any rules. But still, why the hell is our system so corrupted? We request you to do some thing about this issue. The incident took place at the Aravindha signal near Shri Raghavendra Swamy matha. And the officer was in his 50s with a very badly dressed up in his uniform. The other person was in his 30s, slim and he had baldness.
Thankyou 
we can stop crime 1. kill the criminals, who had commited offense more than twice.. 2. decrese unemployment.. 3. educate people.. 4. friendly law makers...

Hello Bangalore City Police,
Off lately I have been seeing lot of duplicate 50 rs notes. Whether small pan shop or petrol pumps. Unfortunately I got one from a petrol pump in chitradurga (while I was on a trip) & when I tried spending that note at a smal grocery shop here near my home in bangalore, came to know tat its a duplicate note. I am sure police would be aware of it. I just want to share my concern here. 
Attaching here a pic of the duplicate note

Hi!! How can I file an FIR online ? 
What's the web link to file an online FIR ? 
Dear Sir, 

Hoping to get some response/action to this fraudulent incident I experienced at a petrol bunk:

Today (17-Jan-2015), I went to this Indian Oil Petrol Bunk near Seetha Circle, Girinagar.

I usually never go to this bunk as I have heard from many of them, guys at this bunk are tricky and can cheat you.

But I had very less petrol in my bike and was in reserve mode. So, had to resort to this bunk and turned my bike towards the bunk. I had made my mind before I went, to collect the print bill/receipt which will give you the details.

I asked the guy standing near the pump to fill for 200 rupees. Guy who stands and collects the cash diverts my attention, asking "Sir, cash-aah ? Card-aah?" The guy who was near the pump didn't even bother to tell me to look at the meter that reads 'zero' (as it is the case in every petrol bunk). Although I quickly managed to look at the meter set for zero.

So the guy started filling the tank, suddenly stops at 50 rupees and tells me "Sir, fifty rupees alwa ?" I told him with stern voice, " 200 rupees haakri..." (guessing that something was fishy)

The guy who collects cash takes my ATM card and swiped in his ATM machine. He again diverted my attention saying I should give HDFC card which will charge 0% processing charge, not with other bank cards.

By this time the guy near pump already had started filling the second time (for remaining 150 rs) not set to zero. Once done, I ask him to give me the print receipt from the pump for which I get a rude answer "Sir, bere customer ge set maadbitte, eega agalla (Sir, I have already set the meter for another customer, not possible to give). So he gives me the handwritten bill (attached) 

I was shocked to see my bike fuel meter which read less than it is supposed to be if I get it filled for the same amount at other station.
Felt cheated !

I definitely know, this would have been the case with many other customers who have had this bad experience.

Looking forward for some response from you.

Thank you!

Hi is there any law for against the people who make loud noise in mid night?? Its a regular thing happening with me. A pg adjoining to our building people make loud noise after drinking every weekend i informed owner but no action taken 
Bangalore City Police this is too much, since when The US Secret Service are asking their demands to order closure the entire national capital, first off, they do not have any jurisdiction in an sovereign country and yet they demand too much on this.  The advance team of US secret service has sought the closure of Central Delhi and Delhi-Agra Highway for three days during President Barack Obama's visit to India. The President will be in India from January 25-27.
Dear Sir .. I have been observing police collect hafta at Vijaynagar Bangalore small road side shops daily twice or thrice .. Like and many shops fed up with that.. And this doesn't go anywhere .. Even police do this won't make us safe approaching them for there mistakes being done ..

Dear sir,

We really appreciate the kind of hard work your department is doing to ensure the public safety and Bangalore city's legacy. Its good that you people are directly connected to public via these social media tools but while doing so manier times you are publicizing the accused identities while they are still not convicted to be criminals, isn't that against their human rights? please enlighten me on this please.

Also, PFB the Tamil nadu High court's judgement on a similar issue while back.

Sir,

Would like to inform about this public nusiance happening near Jayanagar 2nd Block, 9th cross road, near BBMP south zone office.
This corner petty shop next to fruit juice shop which was opened about 6 months back, apparently sells cigrattes because of which college students and working professionals from near by office throng this place for coffee and cigratte, they occupy the service roads near BBMP office and speak very loudly and consume cigrattes because of these public or family persons avoid this side of road and move along other side. Many accidents have apparently in this junction since persons come to consume cigrattes and park their vehicles happzardly on road.

Similar kind of activity is been seen within BBMP office, where in shop no 62 sells coffee and cigratees. College/School students from Community center, Vijaya College throng both these 2 places as early as 7 AM in morning and create lot of noise speaking bad language. 
Night time, under the disguise of light, some persons even consume liquor and throw bottles on the footpaths and leave.

Hope some corrective action will be taken on the same.

Regards,
Arun

Sir, There is no bus service from koramangala to Whitefield. People has to commute through Domlur which causes lots of problems during office hours. I am not sure if this is the right forum to ask for help but if this voice can be sent to right authorities it will be a great help as we need to depend on auto services which eventually causes huge travel cost .This is difficult for middle class family.

I would like to thank Police officer Sridhar from the Ashok Nagar Branch.

Last night I had parked my vehicle on the corner of Residency 1 st Cross Road next to Shankar Nag theatre. It is a free public parking zone. Few unauthorized guys have been collecting money from commuters without any valid receipts. I refused to pay the guy as he did not have a valid receipt for parking fee. I later went on to watch the movie.

When I returned at 1 AM in the night after the movie, I was shocked to see that my front wheel has been punctured. The touts at the parking place had done it. I am sure about it as that guys start using foul language on me when I parked and left.

Now Mr. Sridhar who was patrolling at that time saw my situation and immedialy helped me in getting a guy who can fixture my punctured vehicle at 1:30 Am in the night. Without his help I would have had to park my vehicle there and head home.

Mr.Sridhar has informed me that he will take strict action against these touts in that area. This unauthorized parking fee collection is very much there in and around Bridge Road M.G road area. Near the entrance of Church street, In front of amoeba bowling alley, on Museum Road near Church Street Social Club.

Again would like to thank the officer for helping me in such cold temperature at 1 in the night.

Hi Sir
My wife phone was stolen at the St John's hospital on 3rd Dec, 2014, and logged a complaint with Koramangala Police station next day. I was not given any FIR number and was told that they will be tracking the phone using IMEI number, upon repeated visits to the police station still I did not get any information, also to my understanding it was a complaint of pickpocket but the officer asked me to write a complaint as a lost phone. 

My wife's phone contains lots of personal information like personal photographs, identity cards scans  and bank passwords. I have all the details regarding the complaint and IMEI number etc. and would be greatly thank full to you if I could get some help. 
Thanks 
Happy Sankranti to our brothers and sisters in the Bangalore City Police!

Sankranti was an emotional day for us this year. A few days ago, one of the children of a worker at our home's building site was kidnapped when his parents were having their lunch. The innocent family had no political connections or special privilege other than being one of our fellow citizens with the same rights afforded to every resident of our country. A small childs right to freedom had been violated by a couple who kidnapped him. 

Thankfully, the family is celebrating because the child was reunited with them today. Along with a huge dose of good fortune, what we saw was a coming together of community, complete strangers and importantly the efforts of our own Bangalore City Police team at MICO layout police station in driving toward a positive outcome. 

Our Bangalore City Police Force gathered facts, worked to find and review video footage from local businesses, canvassed regular hangouts, printed pamphlets and put the word out through the police network that they were on the hunt. The team at the MICO layout Police Station was not trying to find a famous person, but they worked as though they were trying to find an important person. Why was this person important - this four year old son of a labourer? Perhaps because this child was a citizen of India.

Negative press is often attracted by the Police when unprofessional conduct is involved. Against that backdrop, we have a special duty to acknowledge the commitment, celebrate positive efforts and highlight them when our police force demonstrates professionalism and genuine humanness in helping and serving. 

In this case, the fundamental humanity and intent of the staff at the MICO Layout Police Station was in evidence when the child was recovered. Please allow me to share what we saw today: We saw police officers celebrating and giving thanks for the special gift of this childs return on this festival day, we saw officers and staff come out with huge smiles to play with and see the child who had been reported missing, we saw genuine happiness and joy at being able to help and be of service, and we even saw one police officer quietly get some biscuits for the children to keep them happy and comfortable. 

On the occasion of Sankranti, we would like to give thanks for the efforts of the Bangalore City Police Force and hope that our gratitude will encourage them in their important work. Happy Sankranti to our Bangalore City Police Force, and we wish you many, many more successes and happiness in the year ahead! 
Please could you trace who is calling using the mobile - 9136883002
They seem to be tele callers who are trying to call and get details about the Credit Card, I have got a call from them today and they seem to be abusive when they do not hear the right answers. After finding this number on google I seem to find out that a lot of people are getting calls. Kindly help nab the cultprits who are a menace to the society.
Thanks for your help in advance.

This is to request BCP to kindly do something about the spate of roadside eateries coming up around Richards Park....there was another one yesterday cooking in an old vehicle with the gas cylinder kept on the platform!! A matchstick thrown carelessly.is all it takes for a major accident! The funny part was a police jeep was parked opposite this van and they dint even bother to tell him to move from there!! I had to go request them to talk to the vendor....i wish the police would be stricter with such irresponsible people. In fact i think you should evict every vendor and the trash they generate near the park. The very idea of going to a park is to walk or sit and get sone fresh air and not be subject to such trauma.Hope to see some quick action. Thank you.

Sirs, there are lot of private buses ferrying people within the city. I have observed them on ORR, Sarjapur Road and in Whitefield. These buses drive recklessly, worse than BMTC drivers, and can cause mishaps. Just yesterday I observed one of these buses dangerously overtake an i10 car near Total Mall signal in Mahadevapura - this was when the bus had almost crossed the signal. 

Please take strict actions these buses - their drivers, conductors and owners. Not sure if they even have licenses to ferry people locally.

I have seen add in quicker stating that 2015 promo apple iphone 6 -16gb price 19,500 rupees unlocked 1 year international warranty.
Contact us: 8892824963. When you call, plz mention that you found my contact info on Quikr!
Name of the contact person is Anderson William
I called him, he ask me to deposit 1500 INR only and remaining will be cash on delivery. So I have deposit the same to the given A/C. Name of the Bank is SBI, A/c holder name is Abinash Rai, A/c No. is 32870116256, Branch is Vijaya Nagar. Then after two hours he said company has changed the policy, so they ask you to deposit other 3000INR only, so I done the same. After 4 hours he called me and said tomorrow morning 11AM, you will get your goods & remind me @9.30AM. So I called that time he said AGENT IS JUST ARRIVED Mumbai AIRPORT IN THE LAST 15 MINUTES AGO he is BEEN PROCEEDED TO THE CUSTOMS OFFICE BUT THEY ARE REQUESTING FOR CUSTOMS CLEARANCE CHARGES AND REGISTRATION OF PACKAGE OF 9799INR TO ENABLE him to CLEAR THE PHONES AND START COMING TO YOUR HOME-ADDRESS TO DELIVER TO YOU within FEW HOURS. After that i deposited the amount 9799 INR in the same A/c. After two Hrs, again Anderson called me said that need to get the anti-terrorist certificate to use the phone in India & that is much costlier. You will get a call from our UK company, you have to tell them yes I will pay the 172 euro, then you transfer the amount 16170INR (Euro currency172) & mail the transaction screenshot to this mail ID appleiphoneuk2014@live.com. After that you will get a certificate & agent also will get the same, then within two hours, you will get Apple Iphone to the given address. I said no I will not pay, then he said my company will call you, first you speak to them, then you call me I will tell you what to do. After 3hrs I got a call from UK No. is 00447010058862, but no one spoke to me. After 5mins Anderson called me he said company is offering you one more apple iphone to you but they ask you pay euro172 (Indian currency 16170) for that certificate. Post payment you will get the two apple iphone will deliver to you. He is keep on calling me to pay but I requested him I dont want your product kindly return my 14,300 money which I transferred to you, but he is not at all listening my statement, he is keep on saying the same kindly pay the money & get the certificate. After that he tried me twice but I have not responded to him. Now I came to know it is totally cheating by the foreigners (from UK). They are easily convincing the Indians. Kindly be aware of such advertisement if you see in any websites or if you receive any mails. 
Making Primrose Road ONE WAY, not a good move. Please revert the change. Allow LMV and Block HMV I everyday used to take left on PRIMROSE ROAD, from MG Road to connect to Brunton Road at 9.30-10.30 AM. I never faced any traffic jam after new road has been laid. Earlier Road Condition was very bad, vehicle movement was very slow, which used to cause jam. But after new road has been laid, never faced any traffic jam. You can block HMV during office hours as military trucks keep moving there. Primrose Road doesn't carry much traffic if HMV is not allowed. Today it took 15 mins just to connect to Brunton Road from Manipal Center as Primrose Road became one way and movement on Commissariat Road (Bangalore Central to Garuda Mall) was increased and causing traffic jam. Request you to revert the change and make PRIMROSE Road two way and block HMV during office hours.

Good Morning Friends,Always Follow Traffic Rules.
I am planning to bring my old car from Kerala to Bangalore, I have got some questions, Please let me know the right place to contact.

Is there a rule existing in Bangalore for Pay the Road tax with out changing the Registration ? Or do i need to change the registration as well  ? 
Sir... I have seen your morning drive of catching 2-wheeler riders without helmet which is good, so i request to do a morning drive of non-sense parking in busy roads such as Bank colony road, jayanagar area, chamrajpet main road n other places.. and mainly please bring awareness to ppl at bus stands to stand on footpath so that the bmtc bus could take left n give stop instead of standing in the middle of the road. All the above nonsense maybe done for just 3-5 mins which results in hours of traffic jam during peak hours.. this is the reason impatient riders n drivers jump signals as they get frustrated due to slow moving traffic coz of this 5 mins insensible act... thank you.... 
Hi Team,
A suggestion from Public,

As and when the public violates the traffic there should be an notification after the case is registered about the particular vehicle.

Never know when the case is booked and every time we end paying without knowing when the case was booked.

Please look into it.

Please think some thing differently, if possible make the Jayadeva to Silk board as oneway and use the Jeyadeva, diary circle, Forum to silkboard as other route either for coming or going 
Sir, daily it is almost taking 1 hour from HSR flyover to cross silkboard signal. Just imagine the people coming from ITPL how are staying in J.P.Nagar. It is taking almost more than 2 hours in one direction. I know because of BTM narrow road, you are also not in a position to do any thing but as a suggestion, please have an experienced cop at 15th and Udipi garden signal. The road after Udipi garden signal will be mostly free. So if the more amount of traffic is passed out from the Udipi Garden signal, then the traffic from silkbaord also can be sent towards the Udipi Garden Signal 
Dear Sir,

This is to bring to your notice that the first main road of Yeshwanthpur starting from the Mosque proceeding towards Mathikere (B Narayanaswamappa  double road) has a lot of shops and footpath vendors encroaching and extending selling their products on to the footpath making it extremely challenging for people to walk and use the footpath. To add to the commotion there are fruit vendors too spilling on to the road, along with two wheeler and heavy duty Vehicles too allowed to be parked adjacently?

The road regularly sees blockage and people being put in to inconvenience because of this. I am also sure that it is not a tedious task to ensure some discipline is got in here. Most senior citizens fear their lifes in this commotion. 

The second cross sees a full fledged market being set up on the road during the mornings inconveniencing motorists and local residents. How can permission be given for a road to be used for such a thing?
I humbly request if the Yeshwanthpur traffic police team could help in making sure that people are given back their right to walk on the footpath and ensure the vendors are relocated. I write to you with a hope to see swift action and help in making the city a better place.

Regards, 
Ashley Fernandes 
Dear Sir, This is to bring to your notice that i see a lot of cars around Nayandahalli junction (Mysore road) and around with very dark sun control films (dark tinted glasses) with writing on the number plate reading "Karnataka rakshana vedike" and "Jaya karnataka". Requesting if the police could take action on these vehicles. Will also try posting pics too to make tracking them down easy.

Good Morning Friends,Always Follow Traffic Rules.
Isn't the law same for all? No tinted glass... 
Help required. I have purchased a flat in Somsundarpalya, HSR Extension in 2010. As per agreement Builder should have completed the construction in 2011 (December). But he gave several reason for the delay and finally in 2013 (November) I have filed a compliant with consumer forum for the compensation due to the losses I incurred due to delay in construction, which is still pending. In 2014 (February) builder gave possession only by finishing inside the house and promised to register the flat and finish the work in another 6 months. Recently in the last 2-3 months he did registration for most of the owners and denied registration for me stating the reason that I have approached consumer forum and case is still pending. As per my knowledge and inputs from lawyer consumer case is only for deficiency of service, legally does not hold any hindrance for registration. Builder is asking me to withdraw the case to register the property, with out any compensation.

Current state of the builder is not far different from when I occupied. 

1) Common area painting is not done.
2) Lift work not even started. (3 lifts)
3) Other amenities like Kids play area, Jogging track (as per agreement) not done.

I have approached HSR Police station to get the issue settled and get the property registered under my name. After discussion with builder I have given 2 choice.

Withdraw the case to get the property registered or wait for consumer case decision.

I am not ready to withdraw the consumer compliant since the builder is completely failed to act as promised and all the work is pending since I occupied the flat. 

1) What is the guarantee that builder will complete the pending work as per agreement? 
2) Who will compensate for the delay of 2+ years, registration cost increased 3 times from the time I purchased the flat. 

Even if consumer forum provides a judgement (other 2 owners received judgement 2 yrs before to pay compensation) builder will appeal in the state commission, which will take another few years (Builders appeal in another 2 owners case is still pending at state commission). Builder will deny registration even then, same done for others.

I request BCP to advise and support me to get the property registered in my name. I am ok to wait for compensation until the case is over even he appeals in higher forum. 
 The Bangalore City Police are likely to set up a centralised command centre for their patrol vehicles and closed circuit televisions cameras to ensure speedier response to complaints by citizens.

Dear sir pls take action on high been lights especially on 4 wheel rs & no plats on transports vehicles 
Last Friday, I went to HAL police station with my friend to register a mobile lost complaint. After waiting for some time I went to the toilet and I was shocked to see the condition of the toilet. Fortunately I forgot to take the pic. Is it so hard to keep a maid or housekeeper to keep the toilet clean? Is Karnataka govt. so poor or irresponsible? How the police officers or other staff uses the toilet? It was in pathetic condition! Good health & hygiene is also required to serve the state / country.

REPLY : Earlier there was a right turn at ejipura junction for those coming from air-view point. because of too much traffic congestion during that time. To ease the traffic in between air-view point, ejipura, & sony world junction  right turn was banned at ejipura junction. Now comparatively traffic congestion is less, generally right turn is not allowed. In sony world as you know there is a right turn, is not more than 400 meters from ejipura signal they can use it. Also we are booking cases against those vehicles stopping at ejipura signal  to take right turn towards ejipura

Hello Sir,

Could you please do something about the way people are driving on Mahadevapura road towards KR Puram. I see lot of bikers driving on pedestrian pathway. Also, the traffic that comes from ORR near the traffic light on intersection before K R Puram railway station (under the ORR flyover near Hyundai showroom) causes huge traffic pile up for traffic coming from Mahadevapura.

The entry and exit of two wheelers underneath the railway line opposite to Honda showroom on Mahadevapura road is also a concern. If something can be done on this regard, it would save lot of traffic pileup. People drive in wrong direction which is not good. Looking forward to swift action in this regards.

Thanks!!! 
Dear BCP, still autos plying from Kodigehalli, do demand more money or refuse to come. Also, the share auto concept is making risky to drive in between Kodigehalli gate till kodigehalli railway gate. Can you please do the needful.

Siddhiah road from Urvarshi Theater to Double road is narrow. Traders/Shopkeepers have dumped all their material on Footpath. There is no place for pedestrian to walk on either side of the footpaths. Hence People are forced to walk on road. With heavy traffic and narrow road it is very dangerous to walk on the road. Parking is haphazard on this road. Some people do not follow one way rule. Please clear both sides Footpaths immediately and streamline the parking on this stretch of road.

Are Bangalore Police a privileged clan that allows them to flout the one way rule between Garuda Mall and Brigade Road HM Tower junction? Despite a cop being stationed on the Garuda Mall who fines all motorists coming the wrong way, Police vehicles regularly flout the rule, who are of course never stopped and instead given preference to pass through, even though they are not the duty vehicles. Who should we go to to complain?

Respected sir,
I am HITESH.M, a 22 year old musician from Bangalore and working in Chennai.
It is really sad to see the condition of my country becoming worst day by day. People are not scared to break rules in our country and they don't even respect the law and order of our country.
Today (January 10, 2014) at 1:20pm, my father and me were going to bank in Rajajinagar. We saw people breaking the traffic rules and I told my father that we should take few pictures and send it to Traffic Police department. So my father literally blocked the way for people who were riding bikes on the other side of the divider near the Wariyar Bakery and I took few photos which I'll attach in the mail.
We also took a picture of a person riding a Bullet (KA - 04 - EG - 3799) who also came on the other side of the divider without helmet disturbing the traffic on the other side. That person was so arrogant that he was proud to break rules. He threatened my father to beat him up, hearing which even I challenged him to do so if he had guts. He took his mobile phone and he tried calling someone and hence even I called Addl. Commissioner of Police (Traffic) but couldn't talk as there was lot of disturbance around and I hardly could hear anything. I saw civil police in the corner so I decided to take his bike key and give it to the police. Seeing that, the person in the bullet punched me on my face and took his key and came forward to beat me. Hence, as the act of self defense I held his hands and pushed him even my father came to help to me. That person was not even strong enough to stand firmly when I was pushing him, only his outlook was tough.
But sir, it is to my shame that the civil police didn't do anything rather than watch the act like an audience. Seeing that, I told the police officer pointing at that person to take some action. After that the police asked that person to park his vehicle on the side of the road. And to my surprise the officer present over there wanted to file an FIR against me and my father for domestic violence! (Really?) So I told that officer to file an FIR as I was the one who got punched on my face for trying to take that moron's bike key and as I am not a Gandhian to tolerate any violence against me or my family. The only act of mine and my father was to push that person who was attacking. But he was not ready to file any complaint against the person who was caught red handed breaking rules and who actually started violence. (Which law in India tells not to react for situation against violence as the matter of self defense?). And there was another person from the public who was at the signal which was 50m away, who came and supported that person as he saw us pushing that person. Thanks to god, there was one youngster a pedestrian and one elderly person who came and told, it was the bullet guy's fault and even one of the officers agreed to it as even he told he saw it. He also told me that he cannot argue with his senior officer regarding this and told our India need more people like me and my father who could revert back against the law breakers (Literally felt blessed!) and asked him why he is not filling any complaint again the person who broke rules. He told he cannot argue with his senior, instead he told me to send a mail or contact the higher officers directly.
Sir, I am really proud the way I have been brought up and I have no doubt in calling myself a responsible citizen of India. I respect the law and order of my country and I follow it. In fact, I don't even care when people shout at me at the signal for following rules early in the morning or late night. The only time I break rules is when the ambulance is stuck behind my vehicle. I either take my vehicle on the side to make way for the ambulance or I move my vehicle to clear the way when I am at the signal (I am sure nobody on this planet can file an FIR against me for that. Our schools have taught us to make way for the Ambulance).
Now, sir I want to file and FIR against all the people who disrespect the law and order of our country and break rules and also the senior police officer (I am not sure whether he was sub inspector or inspector as I didn't notice) for not doing his duty properly and threatening me and my father to file an FIR against us (which we are not scared as we didn't do anything wrong but raised voice against the wrong). And kindly deploy more traffic police officer at the Rajajinagar signal opposite to Wariyar bakery as most of the people come on the other side of the divider disturbing the traffic flow on the opposite side. I really don't understand why the traffic police is not continuing the system which had heavy penalties for people who broke rules? It was initiated recently, and was hardly followed strictly by traffic police all over Bengaluru. That system was super good and I actually had positive feeling towards it as it is the only way to bring back proper system and force people to maintain discipline and follow traffic rules! and with the money collected as fine by police can be used to upgrade equipments and gears for the police and also to install CCTV cameras for each and every street which also helps for surveillance and you can also create employment opportunities for the people who are jobless! Trust me sir, Traffic Police department will be the richest government organizations in India if that system is followed strictly by the police.
I'll continue to do the same work in future when I come across such morons who break rules. In fact I have done a short film called Vision Bengaluru which I'll attach a youtube link.

Reply From Police Inspector, Banasawadi Police station regarding your e-mail petition..

@CPBlr

Received a mail copy of Smt. Nagarathna age 72 w/o Muniswamy,residingat R S palya, Bangalore on 10-01-2015. The Brief fact of the petition is that the, Mrs. preethi is a daughter in Law of the petioner,  Mrs. preethy complainant that the applicant and her in laws can push out her anytime from the house in the nignt. Hence Preethi requested the police to come and visit her house and give protection during night hrs. In this connnection night duty staff visited on the request of Mrs. Preethi and advice to both of them and returned back. so far, police has not harrased the petioner and we don't have any intention behind the visit to applicant house. The petioner made allegation against police is baseless and far from truth.

 A Public Service Announcement you just cant ignore.
Good Morning Bangalore, starting mine and your Sunday on a negative note. 
The picture below shows an on-duty police officer illegally parking his personal/official bike on the footpath, as most of you know, parking or riding bikes on pavements and footpaths is an offence, I want to ask the Bangalore Police, how is this allowed and since when did Police/Policemen become above the law? This happens on a regular basis and we just watch and grunt as to why nothing is done about it.
The area shown in the picture is Sony World Junction ; one of the busiest junctions in Bangalore. There's one more bike parked in front of this bike which belongs to a police officer too! 
Only when we report such cases will the matter taken seriously. 
If Policemen are allowed to bend the rules according to their will and wish, I'm sorry and I shall take this post off! 
Lets see if any "Swift Actions" are taken in this case.
Hope this post reaches the officials,Good day!

 Two Email Appreciation on BTP's Action on Evicting the footpath vendors and vehicles in Avenue Road: 
First Appreciation Email sent by: Mr. Prathik Shroff, R/o Avenue Road, 

Respected sir/madam,
I am a resident of Bangalore living in Chamarajpet area from many years. We also own a shop "Channabasappa & Co" in Avenue Road for almost a century now. We have been noticing the strict measures taken by the police departments in evicting the footpath vendors and vehicles that were being parked carelessly on the narrow and busy Avenue Road. This change has brought a very pleasant atmosphere for all of us and also to the pedestrians especially the ladies and senior citizens. 

We encourage the police and send them our regards for doing this wonderful job. We hope these same measures will be maintained in the future too.

Second Appreciation Email sent by: Mr. B M Khan & Mr.MUSHEER AHMED
Dear Sir,

very motor-able.

The Lifestyle International store at the starting of Richmond road has surely fallen down on its standards. The lifestyle store richmond road bangalore, ruthless hopeless, pathetic no respect no courtesy to customers.
I gave my car for parking at 3:30 p.m on the 1st of january 2015. We finished shopping at 4:15 we gave our valet parking card to get back my car from the parking after a long wait of 20 minutes I asked a parking incharge where was my car and why is it taking so long he told me that there is too much traffic hence it will take another 5 minutes more and the car will be here. This time after 10 more minutes that means after total of 30 minutes when I asked the parking in charge again for what had happened about my car he came up with another reason saying that the driver had forgotten where he had parked the car but now he has found it and he will be here in 5 minutes and he had already left with the car to reach us , but for the bad to worse scenario the car did not come it was already more than 45 minutes and now the parking in charge was also not available because he was hiding around here and there so now I approached the other person, one of his collegue from the parking staff who was aware of the situation and I also explained to him that we were waiting for my car from past 45 minutes but he was trying to avoid and told me that the manager is not here so he could not help, then I asked him to call the manager he removed his mobile phone and pretended to call his manager but the manager did not turn up as we had already become impatient by this time and such a behaviour from him made me angry and I asked him what was he doing on the desk if he was not going to handle the work or solve the customers problem and not even bothering to attend to the customer, this parking staff started abusing me and threatening me and asked me to shut up and simply get lost. As he threatened me and abused me, my friends tried to stop him but he now started to assault us and hit us. Now I observed that the remaining parking staff and drivers instead of stopping him, joined him and accompanied him to abuse and assault us, there were almost 12 or 13 people who put together started to abuse and assault us and to our shock now we were seeing that even the manager of the parking staff and the parking in-charge head had also joined their juniors to abuse and assault us.
Now when I tried to approach the store manager, the store manager was least bothered to attend to this problem and was not willing to come down and I had to call up my brother for help as the two others with me was supposed to board the train to hyderabad at 6:30 p.m.
Even after repeated request to the store manager the store manager did not take any action on any of his staff instead his staff was still threatening us in front of him and even then he did not bother to take any action....
We then asked him to join us to the police station to support but in vain as he did not heed to any of our request. Ultimately we went to the police station and booked a case on these people now let us see what support we get from our police.

This is the POLICE COMPLAINT made to ASHOK NAGAR POLICE STATION but the action taken is unsatisfactory till now or is very very SLOW. 
Hi Sir,

I had registered a complaint on 10-January-2015 regarding an unsuccessful transaction of my BSNL Landline bill payment performed on 26 December 2014 in both consumer complaint forum and BSNL portal.
On the same day i.e 10-January-2015, I received a call from a person named Rajeev- EMP ID-RAJ7759817, claiming to be from BSNL.
Initially he asked me for my Debit card Number, then my bank account Number.
Then came a point where he asked me to add 4 numbers, i.e 12 , 35 , my ATM PIN, 824 and asked me to sum up the above numbers and tell him the same.
when I declined to give the sum of all these numbers as it would clearly disclose my ATM pin he urged the same by giving his name and his BSNL Employee ID.
Then he asked me to hold on for 5 mins. by that time i had received a message from SBI telling that there was an OTP generated for 3D secure registration and another message that my Transaction at POS is declined since my account is locked.
when asked him regarding the same he said all these details were for the refund of my money.
After 3 minutes he asked for the balance in my account and when i declined in tellin the same he said refund cannot be done on maestro card and would support only visa card and asked if I could give the same information on any visa card or of my family members card.
when I declined for the same he said he cannot refund the amount at all and cut the call without any other word.
My concerns with respect to such behaviour.
1. What is the need to ask for my Debit card Number and my PIN.
2. To transfer any amount to a particular bank why do you have to register the concerned persons account for 3D secure registration.
3. What is the need to ask for my balance in the account and the transactions that I have made from the account?
4. I have made a lot of payments online and whenever there was an unsuccessful transaction, the amount would get credited to the same bank account within maximum of 7 days without any such enquiries? why only BSNL follows such rules?
5. Even if this person is from BSNL, how far is it right to ask ur customer their private banking details which the bank itself does not encourage us in sharing it?
6. If there is any illegal transaction made from my account, who is responsible and whom should I go seeking for Help.

BSNL Personnel No. - 8757963597
BSNL Personnel Name - Rajeev
BSNL Personnel Emp ID - RAJ7759817
BSNL transaction Reference no as given by the person - 3510

Please help me out on this.

Please help me in finding this phone 
I had an incident today - at my very own home. A guy who must be aged around 48-50 drove his car right into my gate and damaged the front pouch - when I politely asked him why he could not take a turn properly cos he had a small car and there was ample place to turn also since it is a residence area and the lane narrow somebody could have got hurt - this guy alighted from the car and started hurling abuses of kinds at me - since i wasnt keeping quiet on questioning his driving skills - he had the audacity to open my gate and raise his hand on me threatening me and that's when I realised that he was intoxicated with alcohol - two women and two children were in the car with him - while he was screaming abuses and threatening to hit me - the two women were pleading with him to let it go and the children crying .......................... my thought was not the incident but IF THIS GUY CAN ACTUALLY RAISE HIS HAND ON A WOMAN WHO HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW OR HAD ANY RIGHT ON - WHAT MUST THE WOMEN IN HIS HOUSE GOING THROUGH ?????? DID HE RESPECT ANY OF OUR KIND ????? !!!!! 
I was abviously mad and went to my jurisdiction Police Station,gave a written complaint along with the car number ! The staff took my complaint with no acknowledgement given to me - and sent me away saying they will get the address from the car number i submitted and call me then.......
4 hrs and no call from the police station !!!! Nor did anybody come to inspect the spot of the rowdyism !!!! 
The car driver who was intoxicated got away too as his alcohol levels were not checked on time !!!!! 
I wonder if this system will ever change ?????? Will women who raise thier voice ever be heard ??????
If we are seeing acts of terror, rape, murder, cheating etc right in our neighborhood and in my once beautiful city - who do we blame ????? Is it because of this kind of non action that we see from the people who take an oath of guarding the City and its citizens ????? - the crooks get away scot free and we are just left wanting !!!!! And the systems DO NOT HELP  !!!!!
UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED - a minor case like this did not get any importance - god help people with bigger problems !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I have a peculiar problem. There are couple of neighbors who have dogs in their houses. There are also some stray dogs here. Throghout the day and night we are disturbed by barking of dogs. We have lost our sleep as well we can not stay peacefully in house. I can can some how hush away street dogs but can not silece the neighbours dogs. When tried to tell them to silence their dogs they started using abusive language and also threatened of complaining against me with Blue cross. 
I do not know what to do. My neighbours seem to be not co-operative. Is there any way I can get rid ofvthis nuisance?  Is there any law to prevent their dog from barking continuously? I do not want to get involved in unfriendly situation. Why can't my neighbours let me live peacefully in my house?
Can anybody help me in this regard. Is this flatform ok for posting my problem?

Im seeing in many roads left most lane marked for autos exclusively ,in fact if you mark it for BMTC( in all roads) the way BMTC has to chage lane for every stopcan be avoided  and allow smooth flow of traffic and mark a lane near median for two wheelers.So that no need for them to change lane and block the flow till they reach their destination. 
I seen people with whistle standing near the free bike parking area, commonly near commercial street and demanding parking fees even its written on walls donot pay parking fees,  giving 10 rs is ok even its illegal but they forcing to give them money,  many times I faced so one day I checked how much he is earning,  I counted the bikes parked there it will be approx 50-70 bikes parked and one bike will be parked average 1-3 hour so if we calculate 
Minimum 50 bikes in average 2 hour he is getting 500rs minimum else in peak time 600 per hour even as I studied engineering im not getting that much lol, per day he is getting 2500 - 5000 approx,  2500 *30days  =75000rs minimum and maximum guess how much 
Quite nice business na :-)

Please take action on this complain. 
Anjaniya and Venkatesha Temple at 2nd main Ittamadu, bsk 3rd stage(near rameshwara temple KEB road) is using loudspeakers continuously everyday for last 1 month disturbing our morning sleep. Every Sat 5 hrs in morning and 4 hrs in evening. Speakers are put very close to the apartment buildings. No one is able to relax in their home on weekends also. After hectic work from mon-sat , everyone needs sleep and relaxing time off on weekends. Students and very small kids especially newborns are worst hit by this problem.
PLEASE REMOVE ALL THE SPEAKERS INSTALLED ON BOTH TEMPLES and warn him against tHE use of loudspeakers. Please let them know that without police permission loudspeakers should not be used. 
There are couple of apartments close by and everyone is feeling harassed.
Complains to the police in the past has gone unheard.

Mr Traffic police.. When will we see some sembelance of sense on the roads. Incompetent / uncaring and untrained people that you have on the roads very often not available to manage/control traffic. 
We still see heavy trucks/tippers on the roads. ON the sarjapur road its become crazy. 100's of tippers loaded with construction material plying through out the day. The road itslef needs to be widened wonder when the incompetent govt. will wake up to citizens' woes. ?

Hi Sir, I have been following your tweets and you are doing brilliant work! Just Amazing! I have a small concern of my own too. I live in electronic city and no auto fellow ever puts on a meter here and they charge 60rs for 3km everyday from past 2 yrs. When ever we ask them about the new rule in bangalore, they just say "this is village and all those rules do not apply to us". Can you please clarify the same.

i found this in my people... they dare to quarrel or harrase people in absense of police or any remote area.. targeting the weaker people... people either accept this or defend this by fighting with them.. i will take example - in a traffic road a person couldnt move his vehicle faster as other.. because he dont have that good driving skills.. the people behind them starts to abuse him.. and hit the vehicle... here first thing he dont have good driving skill to tackle his vehicle and second the person behind is damaging his vehicle... third he has fear that.. it will take him to fight.. as there is no police around... this is one of experience.. another.. a group comes and starts abusing around themselfs pelting stone on each other as they are such close friends.. and the stone is just hitting you and your property like vehicle or house around.. and now they are drunk.. now i want to know how police are reacting to these type of complaince after the incident... and these incident are happening frequently.. bcause.. world is moving in fast pace and these offenders thing they will not even be caught in moving traffic or in a abrevated state, in group......

I filed a complaint with the Kothanur police station and they gave me an acknowledgement. When I went to the station again today,they asked me to go the Amruthahalli Police Station as they don't track phones they said.

I'm new to the city.It would be of great help if action was taken from your side

Please Help
Hoping for a postive response. 
Sirs, Is there any possibility of using the Police wireless facility to begin relaying messages to the traffic police all along the passage of the travelling ambulance? The traffic police that is ahead of the location of the ambulance can begin to control the traffic to provide clear passage to the ambulance... This is something similar to what the traffic department does in case of VIP movement.
Also, another idea that I would like the authorities to initiate is that every ambulance should have a bright LED Display Board ( similar to the ones that some of the buses/Vajras flaunt), which has the display of the hospital that the ambulance is headed to. This information will allow the traffic police and the other vehicle drivers to understand the route that the ambulance is likely to take. 
First of all a big thanks to you for the work you are doing specially the movements against the bad auto culture in bangalore. Sir i would just like to request you to do the same in kadugodi and whitefield area also.. the auto drivers in kadugodi demands extremely high charges for a little distance and they behave in very bad manner if we ask why this much. I know the auto complain number is there , but its not always possible to call that number and make a complain specially when you are in real hurry. So sir its a gentle request to you,  please do some activity in Kadugodi area also. We terribly need your help . Thanks a lot.

One of the biggest problem in Bangalore is the way these Autowallas behave, It has never happened to me that an autowalla is ready to go on meter.. most of the time they charge 100 Rs just for 5 kms or they refuse to even go.. even though Traffic Police say that an Autowalla can not deny service to you..the reality is very different. Not only they overcharge, they also behave rudely.. This happened to me just a few days back... I just could not tolerate it.. and though of making a video to show the world what we face everyday... So here is what we created .. 
Please share if you have ever faced this yourself ... Lets spread it till the point that Bangalore Traffic Police notices this and starts taking action...

A separate terror module has been busted by BCP. Substantial explosives seized in Bhatkal. No direct link to church road blast seen yet. 
I would like to bring the issue to notice of Bengaluru city police. Some mischievous elements try to pelt stones at moving train , them aim specifically to people who are using phone. The spot this happens is behind mantri mall besides railways track. Many have lost there phones in this manner. The mischievous elements also throw dirty water as well. I appeal to police to nab the culprits and punish them strictly.

I have given police complain in bheemanagar police station. But nothing helped. I tried to track the phone from samsung website, but it did not help as phone might have been wiped as soon as it was stolen. Please help. Expecting a response. Many told me that this page would help me. So posting it here.

Resp. Sir, For the new hilarious incident of minor rape happened inside the school premisses the police is saying to wait for justice to be done by law and order. But if you could tell us how much time your law and order would take and how much sufferings and questions the victim and her family needs to go through. This is not going anywhere even in case of Nirbhaya the accused are still not got the punishment infect Supreme Court of India have put an stay so what kind of suggestions and assurance you have. And what timeline you could commit for the punishment in this case if we believe in law and order. How would you insure safety of the children inside the school. And shouldn't the school be held responsible in such cases.??? Bengaluru: Yet another shocking incident of child abuse has come to the fore in IT city Bengaluru where a class II student was allegedly molested by a male teacher inside school premises, reports said on Wednesday.

Dear city Police, I commute to my office at residency road everyday. I go past the Madiwala checkpost signal and whenever i encounter a G-3 bus in the signal, it is standing on the road to diary signal blocking all the traffic behind. When the signal opens, they just come back into the lane not caring about the other motorists. How do we deal with this? 
Dear Sir, 
I am a resident of Church Road, BASAVANAGUDI and the photos which I am attaching are of the same area only. The problem is police has barricaded church road and it is creating a huge problem to commuters. Hence ask you to take action and remove the barricades as soon as possible.

Yesterday there was a cop standing near Mud road near silk baord connecting to BTM, many commuters and Riders use this path to avoid traffic in Silk board junction.

My friend was passing by that road Walking and this cop took a photo of her when she questioned he said its not legal to walk in this path and when she pointed out on other people walking he started asking her details when she noted down his Bike (Cheetah) no# KA 01 G 4870 he started shouting.

The cop did not pick his phone up when a bike guy was passing him without helmet.

My friend dad is Ex- RAW agent and when she mentioned this he started telling sister i did not take your pic and showed his phone from his hand.

My friend is certain the pic was clicked as the camera shutter sound was on.

Dear Sir

 
See below the description and series of the incident which happened on 1st January, at your Richmond Road Store, as per recent Doctor Reports SOME Muscles on my chest have been ruptured, so a serious & immediate action is required from your side

 
         I gave my car for parking at 3:30 p.m. We finished shopping at 4:15 we gave our valet parking card to get back my car from the parking

 
         after a long wait of 20 minutes I asked a parking in charge where was my car and why is it taking so long he told me that there is too much traffic hence it will take another 5 minutes more and the car will be here.

 
         This time after 10 more minutes that means after total of 30 minutes when I asked the parking in charge again for what had happened about my car he came up with another reason saying that the driver had forgotten where he had parked the car but now he has found it and he will be here in 5 minutes and he had already left with the car to reach us ,

 
         but for the bad to worse scenario the car did not come it was already more than 45 minutes and now the parking in charge was also not available because he was hiding around here and there so now I approached the other person, one of his colleague from the parking staff who was aware of the situation and I also explained to him that we were waiting for my car from past 45 minutes but he was trying to avoid and told me that the manager is not here so he could not help,

 
         then I asked him to call the manager he removed his mobile phone and pretended to call his manager but the manager did not turn up as we had already become impatient by this time and such a careless behaviour from him made me angry and I raised my voice and asked him what was he doing on the desk if he was not going to handle the work or solve the customers problem and not even bothering to attend to the customer,

 
         at this moment this parking staff started abusing me and threatening me and asked me to shut up and simply get lost. As he threatened me and abused me, my friends tried to stop him but he now started to assault us and hit us. Even the remaining parking staff and drivers instead of stopping him, joined him and accompanied him to abuse and assault us, there were almost 12 or 13 people who put together started to abuse and assault us and to our shock, even the manager of the parking staff and the parking in-charge head had also joined their juniors to abuse and assault us.

 
         When we tried to approach the store manager, the store manager was least bothered to attend to this problem and was not willing to come down and I had to call up my brother for help

 
         Even after repeated request to the store manager and the Floor manager did not take any action on any of them instead they were still threatening us in front of him and even then he did not bother to take any action....We then asked him to join us to the police station to support but in vain as he did not heed to any of our request.

 
         Ultimately we went to the Ashok Nagar Police Station and booked a case on these people.

Also find attached the police complaint made at ashok nagar police station.

But the action taken is unsatisfactory or is very very slow action. I AM NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE POLICE BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO GET HELP SO THAT NO ONE ELSE IN FUTURE FACES SUCH INHUMAN BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OF MY INACTION.

Hence my sincere request once again to all of you.

Dear Bangalore Police,

Road SafetyK R Puram Junction_No FootPath

I travel from Banaswadi to my office which is in Outer Ring Road (Embassy Park)., the moment I reach near Krishnarajapuram Hanging Bridge and take service road which lead to outer ring road connecting ITPL and Marthalli bridge, you will not find any footpath, entire footpath is been occupied by shop and unwanted vehicles, carpenters, special lorry parkings which is always seen, without fail, god knows who own these lorries, without any fear of Police, people walk on road and traffic is badly jam in peak hours. No proper bus stand, people wait on road for buses.

Request you to kindly take necessary steps for this.
Public understands the shortage of traffic police, but some main junctions we just ignore lot of safety towards being Human.

Hope some changes are for sure brought soon.

Arrested 2 accused for theft of 2 wheeler's. Recovered 12 bikes & 3 Autos. Used to use duplicate key for theft.. 
 Journey of a heart - 24 kms in 20 mins!

For the 3rd time in 4 months, Bengaluru Police has helped to transport vital organs for transplantation across the city. 

The Police made the entire 24 km stretch traffic-free and signal-free, bringing down the transit time from over an hour to just 20 mins. 

Salute to the Bengaluru Police for this repeated feat.
Dear Bangalore City Police Team,
I would like to bring to your notice that there are two petty Shops that sell tobacco products, opposite Bon Secours Convent Girls' School, on  St. Philomena's Hospital Road (Campbell Road). Many men, buy cigarettes from here and even smoke right there, facing the Warning against Smoking notice posted on the School wall, the scene is the same even when school children are walking on the exact same road. 
I have tried speaking to the two shop owners to stop [politely], but of no avail.
Yesterday I have notified the local police, and my assumption is that they have gone over to the shops and warned them, yet today while passing by that road, I have seen and video taped 3 men smoking outside one of the shops.
Whom should I approach to stop this? Please assist.
My suggestion is for you to put an officer in civil clothes at the spot for a few days, she / he should have a device with video recording features, and within a day the department should be able to collect enough evidence to take action.
Thank you in advance. 
Towards your safety and security -

I drove next to their car and very politely asked them to not to throw any garbage like this on the road and they calmly obliged Later they chased my car and threw garbage inside my car I stopped the car and questioned them, they first showed fingers, and stepped out of the car and beat me up
First they slapped me twice on my head, and the driver kicked on to my left thigh with his right knee which is still paining even after three hours I could clearly make out the driver was drunk, as he was stinking (alcohol smell)

I believe I did the rite thing by telling them to keep the city clean (Swach Bharat) Sadly public around me stood there still and none stepped forward to help me out
Tomorrow morning I am going to the nearby police station to register a complaint against them

Even if you believe what I did is rite, please share this post to identify the vehicle owner

At the same time, I request the concerned authority to take the rightful action against them and motivate others to promote Swach Bharath

Good Morning Friends,
Your safety is everyone's responsibility, especially yours.
Sir, two men were arrested at last for the misbehave, following a girl on the main road of the Bangalore city,,, how they chased her. no one came to help her ,how sad again it is. If something had happened public would be responsible for that. public must be blamed first. one more thing the young girl should not venture to take snap etc when they find the situation so aggressive, they can ring the police helpline immediately for rescue,,if girls take action also, they cannot protest them because the criminals they can kill her on the spot by hitting her making accident or injury to her. all the girls should be extra careful in fighting on motorbike or traffic way. we must congratulate and praise her bravery who really struggled against the gundas so courageously even if endangering her life into death. she took snap and proved that no criminal can challenge a single girl if she has the courage ,faith and great will power to control gundas. we must salute her courage. same to public who cannot save or protest a girl who is fighting alone in the main street in the metro city like Bangalore 
Hi all sir it's an emergency there was an kidnap done by one of the person in ur hit list and he took her in morning and he didn't leave her yet nd no response on him and all are getting tensed so pls do something and respond fast sir, ,,,,,,,,,,, here is the information of him just check with it. https://m.facebook.com/blrcitypolice/photos/a.475942285773873.112601.464946996873402/817158508318914/?_e_pi_=7%2CPAGE_ID10%2C9842393645 Bangalore City Police...

Bangalore City Police - Reporting a suspicious incident. I was in the car under Marthahalli bridge around 8pm today. A yellow TVS Apache RTR registed KA 01 EQ 3568 having the rider, a 6-8 year old boy without a shirt and another man behind passed by. The boy looked unconscious or was sleeping, but it did not look right. They were heading towards KR puram side. I tried following the bike but lost them before Dodda Nekkundi signal. The man who was riding was wearing a white or light colored helmet and had bags put to his front. The man at the back was roughly 25-30 years hair till shoulder and had a beard and mustache. Kindly look into the same.

 This incident happened on 19th December 2014 at 17:25 Hrs.
The Cop re-fueled his bike from Indian Oil Fuel Station, BTM Layout 2nd Stage.

Fortunately I caught him crossing the lane. This is the way our Traffic Police Men follow the rules. I could not capture the name however; managed to capture the vehicle registration number, KA.03.G.1040

Bangalore Traffic Police, is this the way you influence Indians to follow traffic rules?

Yesterday (04th Jan, 2015), I was checked in 3 different places across the city for no reason while on my work on my bike which has all accessories/fittings in place and no illegal mods/additions on my bike.

The first two group of Traffic cops were really friendly, well mannered and also had no issues with the photocopy that I showed them. But the last checking at 10 PM was the most pathetic one where the constables near Nirmala Rani School/College area in Malleshwaram remarked me as "Terrorist" since the photograph on my DL Photocopy wasn't clear for them.

There were no Inspectors present in the spot and when I requested for time till morning to show the original and also a better photocopy of the same at Hebbal Traffic police station which is near to where I reside. But they denied and the constables started abusing me, calling names and informed me that I have to accompany them to the Police station and they will "take care" of me and my bike there.

I really am a responsible biker and respect cops for their hard work but these kinda cops who call citizens names and trouble them for no reason shame the whole department.
I want a confirmation from Bangalore Traffic Police on few doubts here.

1. The cop told me that any vehicle can be purchased in anyone's name irrespective of that person having a valid DL or not. Is that true?

2. Is it not legal to ask for time to submit the documents if the photocopy is not clear or not available at the moment of checking? I had once read in the newspaper that we get 15 days time to submit the documents. Please clarify this.

i want to share a incident today that happened near indiranagar traffic police station. one of the Auto driver demanded Rs 60 to drop me from Indira nagar traffic police stop to HAL bus stop. I asked him to use meter. he was not ready and said he won't give a ride. I noted his plate number he got angry and fought with me for noting the number. I went to the nearest traffic police stop. one of the constable there who finished the lunch told the driver that the auto would be seized if he don't use the meter or will not provide the ride to the destination. The auto driver finally gave me a ride. i know he might be cursing me, however it was a good action from the constable to preserve the law and helping citizens from auto driver harassment. 
I know you have better things to do but still wanted to draw your attention. The Nice road toll plaza is distributing toffees as change. Their contact centre 080- 65765038 has advised me to file a police complaint 
Respected Sit, I recently read a post on your page requesting the public to report if we happen to see any beggars carrying babies in the traffic signals. I happen to say one lady and a old man carrying Baby in Jayanagar. The signal at Nagarjuna Chimney hotel opp to Syndicate Bank. Also have seen one lady near Soutend Circle Signal. I saw this earlier today. I hope this information is helpful. 
 The Ambulance carrying LIVE HEART Left  From M S Ramaiah Hospital, New BEL Road Towards  BGS Global Hospital, Kengeri. Commuters Are Requested to make way for Ambulance and help us to save live. The Ambulance will move on Cv Raman road, Tumkur road, Nagarabhavi Circle, OOR Kengeri new town, Mysore road and Uttarahalli main road.

Meru Cabs Bangalore Unfair Practices

"Dear Customer, an additional toll charge of Rs.75 will be applicable for Airport drop trips, as per NDTPL guidelines. Meru Cabs, Bengaluru" This was the message which I got   after boarding the Meru Cab today morning. When I challenged the driver and the call center the reason for this payment they were unable to justify as we pay Rs 115 as toll charge while entering the city from Bangalore Airport. The funny part is I was not provided any receipt when I demanded one.
This is unfair and illegal.

GOOD MORNING BANGALORE....DO NOT FORGET TO WEAR THE HELMET

 ....  ... 
Today I came to know why image of police  is not upto that good level where it should be..
The reason is due to some ill-mannered police men.

The scene started like this---
  Today early morning at around 1.00 AM I along with my two friends was going towards Udupi garden signal from home needs,7th main 
(actually were coming after watching movie from Gopalan Cinemas)
  then on the way two police men stopped us and said something in kannad language(i guess)  we said plz speak in English or Hindi.
he  said arrogantly why not kannad and 'what hindi or English?',I said we dn't know it,then he enquired us the reason for being on road late night,I told that we are going for Tea and we are coming after watching movie.
After  listening this they started behaving rudely..I said that you can check for our Identity cards,I am working here ,just by listening this he started abusing and took there sticks(lathi) saying go to your room quickly,one of my friend ran for room but
i said them why are you behaving like this we are not criminals and we hav'nt did any crime neither we are drunk.
just after listening this one of them grabbed my collar and started abusing and slapped me,I told I w'll talk to your seniors then they forcefully tried to make me sit over  there bike..i opposed and refused not to go alone with them and said to my friend that call some one for help and be with me..then they snatched our mobile phones and took us to Mico layout Police Station.
I requested them that whats our crime,you can't do like this and why are you wasting our time in taking us to Police Station and please return our mobile phones,but he said now i w'll show u result of arguing with police.

After reaching Police Station they said something to other police men(in kannad)..and told us to stand at lockup room whole night.
we again requested to leave us and whats our crime why are u doing this,they said dn't argue n stand there either it w'll nt b good for u.

After 1 hour they noted our names,addresses and and said to write a appology letter(that it w'll not happen again and we w'll not go any where in night) in favour of
 Inspector,
Mico Layout police Station.
we were helpless so we wrote an appology letter and came out of police station.
(Rather those two police men should be sorry for there rude behavior and how  dare one of them slapped,abused and miss behaved with us).

Please Sir,
take action accordingly to improve image of police,so that it may not get repeated again with other civilians.
Police is to help people not to harass them.

Thanking You,
Ashish Kumar Shukla

My wife got a message from gmail, saying that there has been an attempt to hack into her account from IP address 122.252.227.178. Immediately she started getting mails from her friend's gmail account, which we realized has been hacked, requesting her to help by transfering "the sum of 250,000 rupees into Zaveri Enterprises,HDFC BANK, ADDRESS: Marve Road, Malad W, Bombay 400064, Acc No: 50200003606395, IFSC NO: HDFC000047, Pan No: ABCPZ431GP, SWIFT CODE:HDFCINBB". I reported the incident to HSR Layout Police Station (under whose jurisdiction our residence falls), but they told it's not easy to track such cyber crimes from their side. I'm informing the same here so that you can take proper action. I think it's the work of a racket which needs to be tracked down ASAP. 
Thank you bangalore city police now there is regular patrol going on in our area I can hear siren sounds of hoysala patrol car and cheetah bike even when I'm inside the house I am very happy and safe. Thanks to subramanyapura police station

Today i got a call from some company in delhi and they told that i have won special gifts from Hdfc titanium credit card as i am very valuable customer to them.They started telling me about the gifts and said that this an information call.After i agreed and said thank you for the gifts they asked to pay me some 7999rs for which i will get redeemable reward points of same amount  and said that all gifts will be delivered to my home address.After few minutes i got a call from different company for the payment, a lady caller explained the whole details again and asked me to get the credit card as she will be initiating HDFC IVR system for payment.Till here i was agreeing about the gifts but after this I got suspicious and said that i will call HDFC credit card people to reconfirm, the lady pushed me for the payment and later disconnected after failing to convince me.

@CPBLR: Sir, I have been attempting to sell my house since last one month. On Quikkr, there is a person with the email ID: abha_melisa@rediffmail.com who has been sending me mails similar to the ones which are talking about millions of USD stashed away somewhere. I have not been entertaining this person. But i am quite sure that some naive, vulnerable and gullible people will be falling prey to this scam. How do I highlight this to the public or help such susceptible victims avoid a heartbreak?

This is to bring to your kind notice and immediate action against the occupier and the owner of Dying unit situated at Sy.No. 88/1, 87/1,2,3, of Hagdur Village, Ajagondanahalli Main Road, White Field, Bangalore East Taluk, (Ward No.84 BBMP) for discharging dangerous effluents into the main stream coming from Varthur Lake without treating it .

I have noticed an industrial shed which has come and which had stopped its operations for some time based on my previous complaint, but from last few days it has resumed its operations illegally, without any permission from the competent authorities in Sy.No.87/1,2,3 and 88/1 of Hagdur Village, Ajagondanahalli Main Road, K.R. Puram Hobli, Bangalore East Taluk.  The shed has been built by violating the Zonel regulations, and the concerned owners have not taken any permission sanctions and licenses for putting up the said construction.

Also very important to be noted that the said dying unit every day discharging effluents which is affecting the vegetation around the area, also it is to be noted that many farmers are dependent on the water of the stream for growing various crops which are consumed by large number people which is directly affecting the health of common man.

It is to be noted that the local BESCOM,  BBMP authorities have taken bribe and not taken any action even though it has come to their knowledge.

I hereby pray your good self to take an immediate action on the said dying unit to stop their operations. And also more importantly seize all the machinery and book all the responsible one for the offence committed by them.

Few photos showing the polluted water let into the stream is herewith attached.

Neeladri Road, Electronic City phase 1 - this auto driver overcharged me, and did not use his meter. He charged me 60 rupees to drop me to a bus stop five minutes away. Can you please do an auto rickshaw drive in Electronic City as well? Nobody goes by the meter here and they charge unreasonable amounts of money. Please help, on behalf of all Electronic City residents I request you to look into this matter. Attached is the photo of the auto registration number, he didn't even have an Auto ID with details attached like the others. 
Hello Bangalore City Police,

After knocking the doors of Avalahalli Police station more than ten times, i would like to share this story of burglary which took place in my house on 21st December 2014, Sunday. 

The incident took place between 2pm to 6pm on 21st December, when no one was at home. The thieves have broken the grill door and then the main door which had 2 locks. Unfortunately our neighbours were also out as it was Sunday. They have taken away 2 Lenovo (office) laptops, 2 Sony Cameras, 1 Sony Vaio laptops, 1 apple Ipod, 1 fossil watch,1 swatch watch, and 5 fancy watches. They had ransacked our house in order to find gold.

We called 100 and then soon the KR puram police Hoysala came to our house, then they mentioned that our area is not under KR puram jurisdiction but under Avalahalli jurisdiction, on calling Avalahalli police station, they asked us to come to the police station. When we went over to file the FIR on Sunday evening around 7:30pm, they said they cannot take the FIR now and asked to come Monday morning. But on doing rounds to police station more than 3 to 4 times, finally the FIR was filed on Monday evening though complaint was given Monday morning itself. It is sad that a FIR takes 24hrs to get lodged. Whenever we visit the police station there are only one or 2 staff members and we never get a chance to meet the Sub Inspector as he is always away. Now it has been 2 weeks and still there has been no response from their end or action taken.

FIR No: 0327/2014
GSC No:PO1916140100395

We have also learnt that there have been lot of robbery incidents nearby our area in Bhattarahalli and Kithanagur Village which comes under Avalahalli police limits. And we fear about our safety now

Please have a look into this at the earliest.

Thank you & Best regards,
Vijeta

Getting many cases of land fraud,cheating.Please get proper legal opinion before purchasing property.Check records from BBMP/Tahasildar,Court orders. 
Dear Bangalore police, 
Kindly guide on an issue.
Central mall in Bellandur has no screening at any of back- entrances. They don't check your cars. There is no one to check bags at the basement lifts. You may easily carry anything inside the mall. There is a screening at the front entrance. But nothing if you go via basement. 
We have always experienced this there. Always complained. 
Even after Church street blast we were aghast to see the same lack of security at the Central mall on the very next day. Security guys say it's not been told to them so it's not their job.
This is not right. This is just not the way to run a mall. 
I continuously see these ads on Facebook and elsewhere... I usually don't fall in prey to these, but, just wanted to know how legally tenable are these? These can fool in lot of people.

Especially when gambling is prohibited. Or is the matter still sub judice and hence it's allowed? 
On Jan 1st after 10 pm, the robbery attempt that took place in my house near e-city. 
This counter in brigade road always seem to be empty almost 80% of the time and all the auto drivers demand even for 2km minimum (Victoria Layout) 100rs or double meter else they don't come .. When we inform we will complain they rudely say do what ever you want .. I have been facing this regularly..  Kindly request you to look into the autos in mg road and brigade road ..  Thank you . 
I have a doubt
Y do crime police catch vehicle...?!!! 
We have traveled from Iscon Temple to Marathahalli from autorickshaw (Total 2 autos) agreeing on meter running. On sitting in one of the auto the autodriver said that meter is not working and we will double the rate that will come in other auto(for total price of two autos).Finally the meter reading came as 38+kms( end up in paying Rs.1000 for two autos) in the other auto whereas we were navigating from GPS at the same time in our smartphone and it showed us 21kms. Driver talked in abusive language in front of parents and when we told that we will raise complain against it they told that they will bribe police and will rescue easily as this city is their territory and you cannot do anything as you are outsiders. Reg No of vehicle is KA-02 AB2016(driver- Nagaraj KM;Badge no-5331AR) and KA02 AB8434(driver-Nagesh;Badge no-18201AR). It is my humble request from you to take strict action against such offender so that they will not repeat such acts in future. Already registered the complaint on "08022868444" complaint No.

Sometimes people are in hurry. I request all to use EMERGENCY BUTTON in their vehicles. Sad thing that people don't use in India. Its very helpful. If you're in hurry or stopped car for phone call on side. It comes on all vehicles. You don't need to pay extra for it. Nor it waste your battery. Nor you need to recharge it. I request cops also needs to use it when they stop their vehicles on sides specially when cops takes rounds on roads & also when they stop for queries.

Congrats and Thanks a lot Bangalore Traffic Police and Bangalore City Police for maintaining awesome law and order along with great traffic regulation on December 31st.  We sleep peacefully because we know that you are there.. :).. Keep up the good work.. Happy New Year 2015 to you too 
Bangalore City Police a statement from the Ministry of Interior. https://www.facebook.com/HMOfficeIndia/posts/400416083447687 Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh briefed media on the implementation of M.P. Bezbaruah Committee Report here today. He said that the recommendations made by the Committee with regard to immediate measures have been accepted.

The Ministry of Home Affairs had constituted a Committee in February 2014 under the chairmanship of Shri M.P. Bezbaruah to look into the various concerns of the citizens hailing from the North Eastern States who are living in different parts of the country and to suggest suitable remedial measures including legal measures which could be taken up by the Government. 

As part of the Legal Measures, Shri Rajnath Singh said the Indian Penal Code (IPC) will be amended for insertion of new sections of 153C and 509A as recommended by the Committee.  The Ministry of Law & Justice has agreed to the amendment.

As part of Legal Assistance, the Home Minister said a panel of seven lawyers including five women lawyers has been constituted by the Delhi State Legal Service Authority (DSLSA) for providing legal assistance to the needy people from the North East.  The Delhi Government will also be providing compensation and monetary assistance to the NE people under Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme 2011.  State Bhawans of concerned NE States have also agreed to play active roles to assist the persons in distress.

Shri Rajnath Singh further said that all the recommendations made by the Committee regarding Special Police Initiatives and additional steps to be taken by the various State Police Forces and Delhi Police have been accepted for immediate implementation. These include:

        Delhi police will recruit 20 police personnel, (10 male  10 female) each from North East States.

        Police exchange programme has been approved between NE States and metropolitan cities including Delhi. 

        North East Special Unit at New Delhi is activated to address the grievances of the NE people. Other States have been advised to do the same.

        A decision has been taken that cases of NE people be referred to the existing fast track courts for early decision.

        A special helpline No.1093 for NE people is being synchronized with helpline No.100. Other States are advised to set up special helpline.

        Various Metropolitan Police including Delhi Police are being advised to post NE Personnel in their force in the visible positions in vulnerable areas prone to crime against NE people. Also they will be advised to have due representation of the senior officers at the field level.

The Union Home Minister said some recommendations relate to the Ministry of Human Resource Development and several steps have already been initiated in this regard including:

        In order to educate the people about the North East, Universities have been advised that history of North East and participation in the freedom movement of the country should be taught at graduation level  and post graduation level, and for this purpose, curriculum be changed. 

        Similar action is being taken by the NCERT with respect to elementary and higher secondary education. 

        A special scholarship scheme for students of North East Region Ishan Uday has been launched from the academic session 2014-15 providing 10,000 scholarships ranging from Rs.3,500/- to Rs.5,000/- per month for studying at under-graduate level in colleges  and universities of the country.  

        Under Ishan Vikas scheme, selected students from school and college levels from the North Eastern States will be taken to Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), National Institute of Technology (NITs) and other engineering institutes for exposure/internship programme.

Shri Rajnath Singh said the Ministries of Culture, Tourism, Information & Broadcasting have also planned to roll out prorgammes for bridging the gap between the peoples of the North-Eastern Region and the rest of the country, including:
 
        Chalking out action plan for educating the people about the rich cultural heritage of the North Eastern States and its wider coverage & promotion at the national level.

        The  North East Film Festival & North East Festival to be organized annually at New Delhi, showcasing culture, films, foods, sports etc.

Besides, the Ministry of Sports has also been roped in this endeavour:

        Has committed itself for identification of talented sports persons from North East with the help of State Governments for arranging their training in reputed sports training centres. 

        Sports Ministry is taking action for organizing Sports Tournaments/Events in the North Eastern States.

        An amount of Rs.100 crore has been earmarked for setting up of National Sports University in Manipur.

 Shri Rajnath Singh said the Ministry of DoNER being the nodal agency for development of the remote region has also initiated the following steps:

        DONER Ministry is in the process of clearing the proposal for construction of a hostel at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and four other colleges at Delhi expeditiously.

        DONER is also exploring the effective measures to deal with the problem of accommodation and high rent faced by the students and professionals/service persons from the North East in Delhi.

        Govt. of Delhi is being advised to initiate measures to resolve the problem, of less payment/non-payment of wages being faced by the North Eastern People.
It is time to Bring in Blasphemy rule and stop the Desh Drohi people like Amir Khan by insulting the world Religion Hinduism. Hinduism is the mother of all religions. Indian Culture is the best and most followed. Why should we tolerate the movie like PK ? I urge Police across India take action and stop theaters by airing this derogatory movie.

I would like to thank the whole team, who had put their complete effort in protecting us on the eve of new year. 
We do believe that, they have their own family, friends and relatives but unlike us, they are not selfish, they sacrificed everything and stood for the cause of our protection. Just think! If you were instructed by your boss to deliver some important job on the eve of new year... what would have been your reaction or response on that?
You know why, I am writing this? because It happened with me. I was told to deliver some important job on the eve of new year. To be frank i felt very frustrated, irritated and felt like, why the hell, am I working? When, I cant spend valuable time with friends and family on such occasions? Then suddenly, it came to my mind about you guys, was thinking about your team, which  forced to me write this, though am not good at it, still I wanted to convey this and tried my best to put it across here. You guys are great! Words are falling short for me to convey our regards to you all. 
We have a great respect on Bangalore policy team and very thankful for your efforts and all the sacrifices did till date.

Hello BCP,

Request your help. Two persons claiming husband and wife (wearing burkha) came looking for a rent house in our locality. They said they want the house for their single daughter. But later i figured they want to find out if any spinsters staying in the locality, making excuses to know their numbers in the name of asking a job for their daughter. Very suspicious talks. I am scared if they are part of a robbery gang. I don't have their picture but their number is 9141788668. Please advice. The incident occurred at 10 PM near Whitefield Main Road. Opp to Hindustan Unilever Research Center. I can be reached on 9900229218. Thanks. 
Very Poor condition of traffic at outer ring road between Marathalli to Bellendur particularly  J.P. Morgan and Panthur road. So many Tempo traveller running from Marathalli to Silk Board carried to passengers. No police constable looks in the Panthur road to J. p Morgan. poor traffic condition at crossing Panthur Road Kadubesanhalli, Traffic coming from more than eight sides, Padesterian can not cross road easily, It looks accident prone area,  There should be red lights on this crossing Or foot Bridge to cross the road,People parks vehicle on the road, Water tankers and the Heavy Vehicles runs on the road whole  the day, No Law and order looks for the Heavy Vehicles in this area. Traffic Police should noted this immediately. 
The things a citizen has to resort to in order to get rogues from playing blaring music even at 12 in the night in a strictly residential locality.

==========================================================
Location: Victoria Layout 3rd Cross

Incident: Person having a party on his terrace and playing loud music that audible throughout the road. Rogues were hooting and whistling well into the night

When: 31st December, 2014 and 1st January, 2015
==========================================================

What did I do?

==========================================================
1) Call up 100 at 11:55PM: A lady picks up and asks me what the issue is. I tell her that someone is playing loud music at 12 in the night. To which she says, "Sir, today is New Year." I respond saying, I understand it is New Year, but playing such loud music in a residential area and disturbing other peaceful people is not the way to celebrate the same. In turn, she asks me which Police Station comes in the Jurisdiction, I respond saying I guess it is Viveknagar Police Station. She then says that she will inform the cops to come and solve the matter.

2) Posted on Bangalore City Police's Facebook page, tweet @CPBlr and @AddlcpLnO. To which I received no response.

==========================================================

What happened? At 12:45AM, there is still music being played.

I then called 100 and no one picked.

What happened eventually? The moron played his music disturbing the entire locality well after 2AM.

==========================================================

What I want to know?

Who were the cops who were sent from Viveknagar Police Station? Or were they sent at all? And if they were sent, what on Earth did they do?

Why did no one pick the emergency call at midnight? What if I was someone running from a murderer? Why call it an emergency number if there is no one to respond to the emergency?

Does no one patrol the area on New Year's when one can expected unruly elements to roam the streets? And if they did patrol, did they turn a deaf ear to the deafening music that was being played well before 9PM and well beyond 1AM?

I know the concerned person has political affiliations. Was this the reason why the police chickened out from taking any action at all? He calls himself the Vice President of BJP, Shantala Nagar. And it is not some isolated incident. It was the same case last year when he blocked off the road to celebrate the birthday of his 2-year old daughter. Can we expect any action at all?

==========================================================

Hi Bangalore City Police,

Just now i saw one of your officer/hawaldar openly taking bribe(Rs 30) from innocent roadside hawkers(Bhelpuriwala/Panipuri wala/Chowmin hawkers) in Koramangala(80 Feet Road). I was standing to buy Panipuri when that police guy came(in uniform) and demanded shamelessly Rs 30 from the hawker to which the hawker gave.He was telling me that many police guys come on a daily basis to collect money unauthorisedly.The incident happened in 80 Feet Road Koramangala(where many hawkers lined up in front of park).Unfortunately i couldnt take the photo of that policemen.

I request BCP to look into this as this is not at all expected from you guys!.Thanks.

Dear Police Team Halasur 

We seem to have a problem at 3rd Main Road - Cambridge Layout (Shiridi Saibaba Temple Road) Halasur.

From 7th Cross to 5th Cross - the entire footpath on either side is encroached and pedestrians are unable to walk .This is a regular feature and despite couple of policemen making rounds and towing van making period appearance - there is no action. Looks like the towing van is more keen  on hapless 2 wheelers to make quick bucks.

Additionally, cars are parked on either side of this main road chocking the traffic.

Can you explain why no action is taken - if you cannot take any action why dont you make this road all pedestrian road so that there are no more complaints?

It is time for action and not just passing the bucks. 
Dear entore staff,family of both BCP as well BTP. Hearty greeting for a prosperous and safer year ahead. My hearty gratitude to keep our Bengaluru safe and shining. Although past a year me at Assam,my family lives at your safe  custody there. Small daughter just now  called up said:" papa you know Bengaluru police well. There was tight vigil and even no drunk was out,nor any nonsense took place." she is class 12th student at Army Pub School,MG Rd. A kids word delighted me. Hats off sir. 
Cool and calm celebrations!!! Cheers!!! Thanks for BCP for very good coordination.. Wish you all a very Happy New Year!!!
